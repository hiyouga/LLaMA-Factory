    Explanation:
        Multimodal 3D rotary position embedding is an extension to 1D rotary position embedding. The input embedding
        sequence contains vision (images / videos) embedding and text embedding or just contains text embedding. For
        vision embedding part, we apply rotary position embedding on temporal, height and width dimension separately.
        Here we split the channel dimension to 3 chunks for the temporal, height and width rotary position embedding.
        For text embedding part, we just apply 1D rotary position embedding. The three rotary position index (temporal,
        height and width) of text embedding is always the same, so the text embedding rotary position embedding has no
        difference with modern LLMs.

    Args:
        q (`torch.Tensor`): The query tensor.
        k (`torch.Tensor`): The key tensor.
        cos (`torch.Tensor`): The cosine part of the rotary embedding.
        sin (`torch.Tensor`): The sine part of the rotary embedding.
        position_ids (`torch.Tensor`):
            The position indices of the tokens corresponding to the query and key tensors. For example, this can be
            used to pass offsetted position ids when working with a KV-cache.
        mrope_section(`List(int)`):
            Multimodal rope section is for channel dimension of temporal, height and width in rope calculation.
        unsqueeze_dim (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The 'unsqueeze_dim' argument specifies the dimension along which to unsqueeze cos[position_ids] and
            sin[position_ids] so that they can be properly broadcasted to the dimensions of q and k. For example, note
            that cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] have the shape [batch_size, seq_len, head_dim]. Then, if q and
            k have the shape [batch_size, heads, seq_len, head_dim], then setting unsqueeze_dim=1 makes
            cos[position_ids] and sin[position_ids] broadcastable to the shapes of q and k. Similarly, if q and k have
            the shape [batch_size, seq_len, heads, head_dim], then set unsqueeze_dim=2.

    Returns:
        `tuple(torch.Tensor)` comprising of the query and key tensors rotated using the Rotary Position Embedding.
