description: Enforces code formatting using Ruff, replacing Black, isort, and flake8 for consistent style.
globs: **/*.py

- **Code Formatting:** Ruff (replaces `black`, `isort`, `flake8`)
- Always use newest version of Ruff. That is use "list", "dict" instead of "List", "Dict", use "str | None" instead of "Optional[str]", etc.
