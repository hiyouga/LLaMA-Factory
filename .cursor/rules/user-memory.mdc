## Always add a step to read @self.md in your thoughts

## Always update @self.md after each request.

## Always update @project.md after each request.

## Rule: Respect and Reference Project Preferences
### On Every Request:
1. **Read** @project.md for:
   - Userâ€™s preferred tools, stack, coding style, formatting, naming, etc.
   - Preferences like TypeScript over JS, Yarn over npm, etc.
2. **Apply** these preferences without exception.
3. **Save** any new user preferences in @project.md.

---

## Rule: Prevent Repetition
### On Every Request:
- Always **read @self.md** before applying logic.
- If a related mistake is found:
  - **Use** the corrected approach instead.
  - **Log** that a prior fix was applied (optional debug).

---

## Rule: Keep Memory Clean and Updated

- If a better fix is found for an existing issue:
  - **Update** that section in @self.md.
- Structure the memory files with clear `###` headers.
- Group by topic if needed.
- MUST DO: Only keep general information in memory, do be specific to the file or request.
- MUST DO: Information saved in memory should be useful and reusable.

---

## Storage Paths
- `docs/memory/self.md`: Persistent log of mistakes and their fixes
- `docs/memory/project.md`: User preferences and custom rules

---

## Enforcement
- Failing to read or update memory files after a mistake is a **critical error**.
- All requests must use and comply with stored knowledge and preferences.
