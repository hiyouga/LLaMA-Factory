According to the official press release, Disney has agreed to fork over $4.05 billion in cash and stock for George Lucas’ studio in a deal that brings together two of the world’s most important intellectual property libraries.\nAs you might expect, Disney is itching to take advantage of its new toys. “This transaction combines a world-class portfolio of content including Star Wars, one of the greatest family entertainment franchises of all time, with Disney’s unique and unparalleled creativity across multiple platforms, businesses, and markets to generate sustained growth and drive significant long-term value,” said Disney CEO Robert Iger in this afternoon’s announcement.\nUnder the terms of this agreement Disney will acquire control over all Lucasfilm iterations. This includes both its traditional film-making studio facilities, as well as the various technologies Lucasfilm has created over the years to further its various media properties. Thus, the gigantic Disney family now includes Lucasfilm itself, special effects house Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, the company’s video game creation division.\nThis acquisition alone would be huge news, but as if to pre-empt fan speculation on the future of Star Wars the same announcement also mentions that a new Star Wars movie is scheduled to appear in 2015. Though the vast majority of recent Star Wars media has been focused on the property’s various animated iterations and LEGO crossovers, this new film will be the first official cinematic continuation of George Lucas’ original Star Wars trilogy. Though very few details are offered on this film, it has officially been dubbed Star Wars: Episode VII, and barring any major catastrophes it should hit theaters at some point in 2015 (if we had to guess, we’d assume an early summer release in keeping with the tradition established by its predecessors).\nPerhaps even more intriguing however, is the announcement’s claim that Episode VII’s release will herald a new era in which new Star Wars movies hit theaters “every two to three years.” It specifically mentions Episodes VIII and IX by name, though offers no solid details on either film.\nWhile the effects of the move won’t be fully known for at least a few months, we can think of a number of a things this new union might change. For instance, currently Dark Horse Comics publishes all Star Wars comic books, but with Disney owning Marvel Comics we can’t see that agreement lasting for long. Likewise, both Disney and Lucasfilm have sizable divisions dedicated to creating video games based on their various media properties. Normally these companies have had to seek outside publishing agreements, but now that they’ve joined forces and massively expanded the number of games either company is capable of releasing in any given year, it makes a lot of sense for Disney to invest in its own games publishing wing.\nFinally, this agreement almost certainly heralds future crossovers between Disney and Lucasfilm characters. We don’t know any specifics, but it’s only a matter of time before we see toys depicting Mickey Mouse dressed as Darth Vader. Whether that sounds awesome or stomach-churningly disgusting is entirely up to your rapidly waning sense of childhood whimsy.\nUpdate: Scratch that last prediction. Apparently Disney characters dressed as Star Wars characters is already a thing.\nOur partnership with LucasFilm has produced over 20 yrs worth of stories. We have Star Wars for the near future, and hope for years to come."

    "text": "I hadn’t been to Red Mountain in over 4 years and was happy to experience it again. Milana Knowles, our VP Day Spa Sales and Marketing, held a Day Spa Retreat there with 35 of our partner day spa owners and managers. She invited me to speak to the group as part of the education part of the program.\nI noticed a general level of improvement in décor, food and accommodations at Red Mountain. Of course staying in one of their new villas made the whole experience much more luxe than I had ever experienced it before. Their dedicated spa facility was a real improvement over their previous “temporary” treatment rooms. Now there is a nice view with a relaxation room, good product choices, and in general a more spa-like feel. The only problem was that either they didn’t have enough therapists or all of their treatment times were booked solid. Seems they missed out on a lot of business because so many people wanted more treatments (including me) and couldn’t get them. Although more expensive than in the past, it still is a good value. I understand they are almost fully booked in October. And of course the hiking, as always, was spectacular.\nWe had arranged day spa retreats in the past but this was our first one in a long time – and the first that Milana coordinated. By all counts it seems it was a tremendous success…with the day spa owners having (in many cases) their first destination spa experience. Milana provided most of the education as she is an expert on retail sales and has managed some of the largest day spas in the country. There wasn’t a question she couldn’t answer! Comfort Zone was the sponsor and they were very generous in gifting all of the participants with facials and an array of their full size products.\nWe reviewed the results of our recent Day Spa Survey 2007 and I even gave them a “sneak peek” of the Top Spa Trends we are considering for 2008. (top secret!) What I like about these retreats is that the day spa owners are willing to share information very openly because they come from all over the country and for the most part do not compete with each other. By the time we all enjoyed the evening Fire Ceremony at the end of the retreat, we had gotten to know each other and become friends. Even shedding some tears together around the fire on that full-moon night, felt surprisingly good."

    "text": "Last month's fixture window provided a tease, but the final set of international matches for 2018 should finally give a glimpse into the real potential of the U.S. men's national team and its immediate future.\nChristian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams, who all had to withdraw from October matches vs. Colombia and Peru because of injuries, will suit up Nov. 15 against England in London and Nov. 20 against Italy in Genk, Belgium, after being included on Dave Sarachan's roster for the European friendlies on Monday.\nPulisic has played only 89 minutes for the national team in the last 13 months, so his inclusion, amid a strong run of form with Borussia Dortmund, will provide a nice jolt for a national team that continues to turn the page and look forward.\nIt's all coming full circle for Sarachan, who began his caretaker role as national team coach with last November's friendly in Portugal, the first match after the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. He'll presumably finish his tenure with the return trip to Europe, as it is widely expected that he will not be given the full-time role by USMNT general manager Earnie Stewart. That role was supposedly going to be filled–or at the very least have a chief candidate for it identified–by Nov. 1, but that loose deadline has come and gone, with perceived frontrunner Gregg Berhalter still alive in the MLS playoffs as coach of the Columbus Crew.\nThose playoffs have thrown a wrench into Sarachan's roster selection, too, with eight clubs still alive and featuring potential U.S. call-ups. That number of clubs will be reduced to four by next Sunday night, and with some MLS-based players arriving later in camp, Sarachan has expanded the roster to 28 players to ensure full training sessions while also giving opportunities to some newer faces.\nAmong the intriguing newcomers are a pair of midfielders in Fulham's 20-year-old Luca de la Torre, who has one cap, and Malmo's 23-year-old Romain Gall, for which this will be his first senior national team camp. Gall has impressed in Sweden in 2018, scoring 14 goals in 30 matches for Sundsvall and Malmo. Veteran and captain Michael Bradley, who had returned last month after a yearlong national-team hiatus, has not been included for this trip.\n\"With the availability of some players that we didn’t get to see in the last fixture window due to injury, the thinking is this roster gives us depth with young players that still need the experience of big games, especially games abroad,\" Sarachan said in a statement. \"With Michael Bradley, there are a couple reasons. The first is that after having earned 142 caps, his need for these games is far less important than it would be for players with less experience. Secondly, Michael’s schedule the past two years with Toronto FC has been virtually non-stop and he has largely played without a break. At this stage, it made sense to give him some extra time off and also allow these games to be a platform for players that lack that kind of experience.\"\nSteffen and Guzan appear to be the top two on Sarachan's depth chart, in that order, but it remains baffling that Bill Hamid isn't called into camp as one of the three options, especially with D.C. United out of the MLS playoffs. Bringing both Guzan and Steffen, whose teams could both advance, seems unnecessary, though the calls are merited based on their form. Steffen, at 23 and with more clutch playoff showings under his belt, remains the present and future of the No. 1 job.\nAs for the No. 3, which ultimately is of little consequence in these camps, Horvath has at least started Brugge's last two league games after a spell of inactivity and is getting the nod in Tuesday's Champions League match vs. Monaco, but he needs to show considerably more on a consistent basis to put his name back among the upper echelon.\nThis is more or less the same group that appeared last month, with Moore, Villafaña and Zimmerman joining and NYCFC's Ben Sweat being left behind. Villafaña should push the up-and-down Robinson for starter's minutes at left back, with the young Wigan player being beaten for pace by recent South American opposition while also showing the penchant for delivering a good ball while getting into the attack.\nOn the other side, Moore and Cannon should push Yedlin to start in at least one of the matches. Yedlin's familiarity with England's players from his time in the Premier League, not to mention his overall experience, would figure to give him the leg up in the opening friendly at Wembley.\nWith Miazga's recent struggles at Nantes and Long's solid showing vs. Peru, you wonder if the starting center back job next to Brooks is up for grabs, though.\nGetting the opportunity to play in Wembley would be a nice bonus for Robinson and Carter-Vickers, who were both born in England.\nAt last, Sarachan has his full complement of young midfielders from which to choose. Pulisic, McKennie, Adams and Weah figure to make up the nucleus of the national team for the foreseeable future, and this is the first time they've all been in a camp together. Barring any injuries picked up Tuesday in Champions League vs. Atletico Madrid or Saturday in the Bundesliga vs. Bayern Munich, Pulisic will make his first U.S. appearance since May and only his second since the World Cup qualifying failure. That's nothing new, but it's no less staggering of a fact.\nIf the four start across in the midfield, that would figure to leave Acosta or Trapp behind them in a No. 6 role, though Trapp, despite multiple apperances donning the captain's armband, has yet to show the consistent quality at the international level to lock down that spot. If given another chance, it's a good opportunity to prove his worth.\nThe thinnest part of the U.S. roster remains as such. There's no Andrija Novakovich, who had been present in past camps but never had the chance to make a dent on the field, while Jozy Altidore is dealing with an ankle injury that cut his season with Toronto FC short and prevented him from being reintegrated into the fold. Going down the line, the options are uninspiring and wholly inexperienced for the moment.\nThat leaves the 18-year-old Sargent, who opened eyes with his play vs. Peru and is looking to make headway with the Werder Bremen first team after shining for its reserves, and Wood, who scored a very nice goal vs. Colombia, to lead the line.\nGetting Sargent, Pulisic, Adams, McKennie and Weah on the field together for as much as possible should be a chief priority in these two games. That they haven't had that opportunity in the last year, with untimely injuries a key factor in that, is one of the real disappointments of the transition phase."

For main course we had Roast Chicken Tikka, Bombay alloo, Charred Aubergine with chilli and mint and a green bean and mushroom side dish, not forgetting the giant Yorkshire pudding!

    "text": "By Alfred E. Eckes Jr.\nDespite the passage of NAFTA and other recent free trade victories in the United States, former U.S. trade official Alfred Eckes warns that these developments have a dark side. Opening America's Market offers a bold critique of U.S. trade policies over the last sixty years, placing them within a historical perspective.\nEckes reconsiders trade policy issues and events from Benjamin Franklin to Bill Clinton, attributing growing political unrest and economic insecurity in the 1990s to shortsighted policy decisions made in the generation after World War II. Eager to win the Cold War and promote the benefits of free trade, American officials generously opened the domestic market to imports but tolerated foreign discrimination against American goods. American consumers and corporations gained in the resulting global economy, but many low-skilled workers have become casualties.\nEckes also challenges criticisms of the 'infamous' protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which allegedly worsened the Great Depression and provoked foreign retaliation. In trade history, he says, this episode was merely a mole hill, not a mountain.\nAlfred E. Eckes, Jr., a former chairman and commissioner of the U.S. International Trade Commission, is Ohio Eminent Research Professor in Contemporary History at Ohio University. His books include The United States and the Global Struggle for Minerals.\nFor more information about Alfred E. Eckes Jr., visit the Author Page."

    "text": "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, \"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\" When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, \"In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: \"'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'\"\nThen Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \"Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.\"\nWhat were the religious leaders of Jerusalem thinking?\nThis is what has always puzzled me about this story. Not the wise men, and not Herod – although more on them another day – but the reaction of those in Jerusalem. Here are these strange foreigners with news of the Messianic birth. “All of Jerusalem,” we read, “was troubled” at these news. Agitated by it. Muttering in the streets.\nBut what happens? The scribes and chief priests tell the wise men that the Messiah is to be born in Bethlehem. They know the time and the place. Their response, though, is to... do nothing?\nHow could these people not be packing their bags for a trip to David's city? How could they miss the chance, even if it was a tiny chance, to see if these strange foreigners could be right? If the Messiah had been born?\nMatthew doesn't tell us. But I can guess. I imagine, at least for some of them, that it was just a matter of routine. They had things to do! Responsibilities! The temple isn't going to run itself. The Scriptures aren't going to be copied without someone copying them. People need to be taught. Decisions need to be made. “There's so many good things we're doing, we don't have time!” they'd say.\nThey didn't have time to come a meet their Savior.\nIt is easy for us to feel judgmental, but we do the same thing. We get so busy with the good things in life that need to be done that we sacrifice the time it takes to meet with the Savior. We can't fit space in our busy schedules to experience God's salvation.\nI suspect the problem for the religious leaders, as it is for many of us, was simple. They had let the good things in their lives crowd out the best things.\nWe are busy people. We've got 24 hours in a day and 1,000 things we could do with them. And that's not itself wrong. But it can turn into a trap. Here's what I find myself doing. I am busy, and I look at the things that I'm busy with, and I ask the question “Are they good?” Because, obviously, there are ways to spend your time that are bad. Shouldn't do that. I ask whether they are good things, and if they are, I assume I'm living life the way I should. But if all we ask is “are these things good,” even if our answer is yes, the outcome can still be bad and destructive. Because good things can often be the enemy of the best things.\nThink about a parent who never makes time for their kids because of work. Some of us had those parents. Some of us can struggle with being them. That parent isn't doing bad stuff. Their hours are being spent on productive things. God made us to work, and to do it excellently. The problem is, that good stuff that robs their children of the time they need. The good, when it isn't looked at carefully, easily becomes the enemy of the best.\nOne of our callings in this time between Christ's comings is to spend our days pursuing what is best. Which isn't always easy - it often means giving up good things for other things that are better. There is often a sense of loss in that. Yet that loss is more than repaid by what is found."

    "text": "If you’ve ever been to the MOMA in New York City, you’ve experienced a plethora of wildly different styles and mediums of modern art. Much of it evokes strong reactions from the spectator from the mundane, “I don’t get it” to a fierce, “that’s the ugliest thing I’ve ever laid eyes on.” Many must have looked at the colorful works of Miró, Kandinsky, or Klee in their day and thought, “that’s not right. It needs to change.” But over time, their pieces have become regarded as great art. Picasso depicted his gorgeous lovers with green skin, eyes stacked horizontally, and noses protruding from their foreheads. His imaginative interpretation of beauty jars our senses, and while on the surface his abstract portraits may be perceived as “weird” or “ugly,” vibrationally his paintings irrevocably capture our attention. Young graffiti artist Basquiat’s work is not conventionally beautiful, but people connect to it fervently on an energetic level. When we experience art, we are examining the world through the artist’s perspective and experiencing his or her passion, intensity, and raw emotion. It resonates with us because on some level we acknowledge the artist’s ability to access their unique Soul Signature to produce those works of art. Regardless of our aesthetics, we accept it for what it is, relish the opportunity to share the artist’s light and expand our souls in the process.\nBy embodying their Soul Signature, great painters tap into a wellspring of inspiration and the result is not always water lilies on a tranquil Giverny pond. There is always a story behind a great work of art – a story that is at times painful, frightening, or even tragic. It may be difficult to look at or you may want to avoid it altogether but it’s the inclusion of the story, not the absence of it that makes the painting more moving and impactful. That engaging creative process can only occur when you’re in connection with your Soul Signature. The full magnitude of creativity flows most effortlessly when you’re in harmony of yourself and you start to see something beautiful in what you once thought was ugly. You begin to realize why you are who you are and start uncovering the masterpiece you were born to be.\nIn the eyes of the Divine, one artist is no better than another. Raushenburg is as brilliant as Rembrandt. It’s all art and all spirit, flowing freely onto life’s canvas and signed with individual fingerprints. Your Soul Signature vibrationally allows you to come into an awareness and harmony with your own artistic expression no matter the form it takes- wife, husband, mother, father, PhD, dog walker, etc. There is only recognition that you are your perfect self. Accessing your Soul Signature allows you to appreciate the masterpiece you are and lovingly embrace the self-portrait you see when you look in the mirror. What you see is not broken. Even with stacked eyes, green skin, and a misplaced nose, you are a glorious, celebrated work of art."

    "text": "Britain’s cost of living squeeze shows no sign of easingwith new figures showing that prices are still rising faster than wages.\nInflation is when prices rise. Deflation is the opposite – price decreases over time – but inflation is far more common.\nIf inflation is 10%, then a £50 pair of shoes will cost £55 in a year's time and £60.50 a year after that.\nInflation eats away at the value of wages and savings – if you earn 10% on your savings but inflation is 10%, the real rate of interest on your pot is actually 0%.\nA relatively new phenomenon, inflation has become a real worry for governments since the 1960s.\nAs a rule of thumb, times of high inflation are good for borrowers and bad for investors.\nMortgages are a good example of how borrowing can be advantageous – annual inflation of 10% over seven years halves the real value of a mortgage.\nOn the other hand, pensioners, who depend on a fixed income, watch the value of their assets erode.\nThe government's preferred measure of inflation, and the one the Bank of England takes into account when setting interest rates, is the consumer price index (CPI).\nThe retail prices index (RPI) is often used in wage negotiations.\nThe consumer prices index, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 2.8% for August, up from 2.6% in July, and close to the four-year high of 2.9% reached in June.\nTransport costs are likely to be one of the main drivers of higher inflation, as petrol and diesel have become more expensive in recent weeks.\nWages, though, are not keeping pace. City economists predict that Wednesday’s labour market statistics will show that average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.2% per year in the three months to July. This would be an improvement on the 2.1% recorded a month ago, but still means that real wages are falling.\nAnalysts at Investec predict the UK unemployment rate could drop to 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. But they caution that there are still no sign that wage growth is taking off.\nBusiness advisers BDO have warned that the rise in employment has not yet delivered higher productivity either.\nPeter Hemington, a partner at BDO, explained: “UK employment law is sufficiently elastic to give employers the comfort that they can flex workforces quickly as market conditions change.\nUnion leaders will renew their calls for the government to lift the 1% pay cap on public sector workers, when they gather for the Trades Union Congress in Brighton.\nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said Theresa May’s administration was “out of step” with the national mood.\n“After seven long years of pay freezes and limits on their wages, ambulance workers, school meals staff, police and community support officers and other public service employees all deserve so much better,” Prentis said."

    "text": "Chicago is up next in our Team Talk series, this one also written by Adam Filadelfo. Follow him on Twitter: @Frostt24.\nAlways a potential to be a breakout offense, Da Bears seem to fall just a bit short. If this is the year they put it all together, you are going to want to own some of these players to help bring you a fantasy football championship.\nJay Cutler - Let me start off by saying Cutler has the tools to be an elite level quarterback. Now let me say that he isn't an elite level quarterback. Maybe it's his approach to the game or maybe it's his attitude, but something is holding him back. He has a great arm and sometimes looks like he's turned the corner, but just when it seems like he's put it all together he goes and throws an ill-advised pass that gets picked off. Maybe he thinks his big arm is all he needs. There were just too many games (last year especially) that Cutler either failed to show up or threw more interceptions than touchdowns. At this point, he's probably best suited as a backup fantasy quarterback.\nMatt Forte - Forte is more valuable in PPR formats simply because he is an important part of the passing game. But what hurts him most is his lack of scoring touchdowns. No matter what format you may play in, nothing is more valuable than touchdowns. That may be the only department Forte is at a disadvantage, and he certainly has room for improvement there. He's currently going in the second round of drafts and in a new system with new head coach Marc Trestman he could see a boost in touchdowns scored.\nBrandon Marshall - One word comes to mind when describing Marshall. Beast. Not only is he a weapon downfield, he's a strong red zone threat as well. Brandon is a physically gifted athlete with the ability to make outstanding plays but may need another wide receiver opposite him to reach his full potential.\nAlshon Jeffery - He showed signs of breaking out last season but never quite took that next step. Some are predicting this could be the year but I'm tempering my expectations. Marshall is clearly Cutler's favorite target and it sometimes seems Cutler only sees Marshall on the field. That could hurt the value of Jeffery even more. Until he shows he can do more than just flash signs of ability, I'd stay away. Unfulfilled promise makes him worthy of a late round flier in your drafts.\nMartellus Bennett - Bennett could have a really good year in Chicago. He's a legitimate red zone option in a season where tight end seems at a premium. He also gives Cutler another option at the goal line. He's an every week starter at his position that could very well help a Bears offense that had to settle for far too many field goals last season. Keep in mind that Marc Trestman is known for being an offensive minded coach so that could help boost Bennett's value.\nMichael Bush - He won't see much work as long as Matt Forte is healthy. That being said, there's a good chance Forte doesn't stay healthy for the entire season. If the Bears need him, Bush can produce. Even with Forte in there, Bush has been more of the goal line back and could be valuable by means of scoring touchdowns. Only problem with that is it's almost impossible to predict touchdowns. I think right now, Bush is worth drafting as the clear cut handcuff for Forte owners. He probably won't hold much value for any other fantasy owner.\nDevin Hester - Let's get this out of the way right now: The Devin Hester as a receiver experiment has failed. However, in fantasy leagues where owners are rewarded for return yards, Hester could still hold some value. Hester is one of the most electrifying return specialists to play in the NFL in quite some time. Any time he has the ball in his hands, there's a good chance he can take it to the house. In most leagues if you want to get the benefit of Hester's return ability, you're going to want to draft the Bears defense and special teams.\nD/ST - Make no mistake about it, the Bears defense will be one of the first defenses off the board come draft day. Only problem with defenses is an elite defense one year isn't necessarily that the following year. What made the Chicago defense so great to own in 2012 was their penchant for getting turnovers. You can't count on that happening again, but the potential remains. Regardless of that though, you should be confident using the Bears defense in most matchups."

    "text": "Hi there lovelies, long time no see. I have been testing quite a number of products the past few weeks, and since COSRX has been gaining quite a bit of attention recently, I decided to do a review focusing on this brand itself. Many followers on Instagram also asked for my opinions regarding COSRX products. Today I will share with you my opinions on the product that I have been tested for approximately 2 months now: COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid. Stay tuned for my future review for BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, and Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence.\nBefore we started, I have a confession: I am absolutely in love with COSRX as a brand. Their ingredients list is relatively short and pretty straight forwards. Products is fragrance free, paraben free and coloring free, which is a huge plus for sensitive and acne-prone skin like mine. After using their products for a while now, I am confident to say that my skin has been greatly strengthened and healing process happens much faster for the aftermath of my acne fighting, scars fade faster, skin texture is less bumpy and I am indeed a much happier girl 🙂 My goal is to finish the rest of my skincare and convert all my products to COSRX and COSRX only. Yup, I am absolutely in love. Now I shall share in details about the product that I have been tested.\nAHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid clears away old dead skin cells trapped inside the pores. Works alongside vitamins, whiteners and natural moisturizer treatments. Managing dead skin cells without unnecessary stimulation. Helping skin management while creating healthier skin with more vitality. Star ingredients Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water: An alpha-hydroxy acid naturally-occurring found in sugar cane and malic acid, derived from apples, which will help to exfoliate dead skin cells, reduce the appearance of fine lines, sun damage and hyper-pigmentation, diminish the appearance of large pores and acne scarring. A great ingredient for reducing blackheads, whiteheads and troubles on skin. It even moisturizes the skin at same time as removing dead skin cells. You will find your skin is smooth, soft, and comfortable.\n1) Moisture, pore control, and brightening. It immediately purifies and tones up your skin leaving is clearer and more bright.\n2) Whitehead clearance. No more difficulty removing whiteheads and sebum !\n3) AHA product with hyaluronic acid. It controls excessive sebum and achieves excellent moisture retention in combination with hyaluronic acid.\n4) AHA for repairing skin damage. Works well for sun damaged skin. Also it is good for spots, dryness and trouble.\nThe product is packaged in a very simple and straightforward packaging, just like the formula itself. Even though it might deemed to be a little bit bland for my aesthetics, I honestly do not mind it that much. The functional aspects of the packaging is strong, with sturdy packaging, excellent quality pumps that is designed nicely. One pump is enough for my entire face.\nEven though the product claims to have Apple Fruit Water as the first and start ingredients, I was so put off with the smell at first. The smell was so pungent and strong and definitely does not smell anything like apple. Overtime I get used to the smell a little bit, but I can’t help but stop inhaling whenever I apply this product all over my face.\n5) AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid is high concentrated product. Please use a small amount on areas with whiteheads and dead skin cells. Begin with using only once a week, and after skin has adjusted, use 2 to 3 times a week to maintain clear skin without dead skin cells, sebum and whiteheads.\n6) When you use AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid, do not use other exfoliating products on same day.\nI did not want to mess with the caution, so I use this on alternate with the Blackhead Power Liquid, and notice great results. I normally use this after my toner step, when my skin is perfectly cleansed and balanced. After waiting for 20-30 mins, I move on with a hydrating essence/serum, followed by sheet mask, light gel cream and sleeping pack. It is important that other products following your acid treatment step are all hydrating to help sooth the skin after the treatment.\nIt is an extremely light-weight texture that is as runny as water. The liquid absorbed onto my skin with minimal efforts, a little bit of tapping with help it absorbs much faster.\nThis using in conjunction with the Blackhead Power Liquid improved my skin significantly over the past 2 months. I must say, my skin has never do so well for the longest time ever. All my acnes and pimples are in control, scars are fading quick and most importantly, those funny bumpy texture on my skin is gone. Now since I use this together with the Blackhead Power Liquid, it is hard to identify which problems is solved by which products, but I believe this controls stuffs that happen more on the surface of your skin.\nYes I will, together with Blackhead Power Liquid as a duo as these are the best treatment I have found in years.\nThanks for your review I really love it ❤️ But I want to ask you this to make sure 🙂 I currently order 3 products : 1/klair vitamin c , 2/Cosrx aha 7 power liquid , 3/Cosrx bha power liquid. As you say that you use it alternately so I want to know that can I use it like this ? Ex: on Monday I use aha and Tuesday I use klair vitamin c and Wednesday bha. Is it okay to use it like?\nIf I use them for the first time I only use them once a week first right?"

    "text": "You only get one chance to make a first impression, which is why a good introduction goes a long way. With this in mind, we’re excited to debut a new Welcome Email option to help administrators introduce TigerText to new users.\nWe aimed to keep the content simple and visual. There’s a space where each organization can write a welcome message for new users, and Admins can customize the header, for example by adding their organization’s logo. The email is formatted to look good on both desktop and mobile. The Get Started button guides mobile users to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, while sending desktop users to the TigerText web console.\nAdmins can set the Welcome Email to be automatic for newly added users or leave it manual for more control of who receives the message and when. To help admins track progress toward adoption, we’ve also added an Activation Status column in the Users Tab to show whether a user has received a Welcome Email and when they activate their account.\nWe designed this feature to help organizations encourage staff to use TigerText sooner. Because everyone benefits when more coworkers join the conversation in less time: organizations protect more information, staff members save more time and enjoy simpler collaboration, and overall the workplace makes decisions faster. We think that’s a welcome outcome.\nHow to access this feature:Admins can customize and send the new Welcome Email from the Org Settings Tab."

    "text": "The powerful earthquake that hit the island of Zakynthos with 6.8R in the early morning hours of Friday had surprisingly few damages. Despite its force, there were no casualties and “no injuries” as the mayor told media Friday noon, several hours after the earthquake.\nSome old uninhabited houses and buildings collapsed, slopes came down a damage on the port of the island. But no casualties, not even injuries.\nScientists estimate that had this earthquake hit another area in Greece the damages and casualties would be disastrous.\nHow comes that the island of Zakynthos survived the earthquake, one of the most powerful ever occurred in Greece, with relatively minor damages?\nIt was because of the 6.8R earthquake in 1953 and …a bit of luck.\nVideo: The earthquake stroke on 12. August 1953 between Kefalonia and Zakynthos. It was so powerful that it raised up the whole island of Kefalonia by 60 cm and caused widespread damage throughout the two islands. 480 people died, more than 2,000 were injured.\nIn the capital of Zakynthos of the same name, only two buildings survived the earthquake. The capital of Kefalonia, Argostoli, suffered substantial damage and all of Kefalonia’s buildings were flattened except for those in Fiskardo in the far north.\nEven since 1953, all public buildings and private houses in the Ionian Sea follow strict anti-seismic regulations. It was because of that earthquake that Greece adopted anti-seismic regulations in the construction. Regulations went into effect in 1959, modifications were added in 1984 and 1985, notes in.gr.\nOf course, it should be questioned how strictly the anti-seismic regulations in construction are being followed, because the earthquake in Kefalonia with 5.9R on 24. January 2014 caused pretty much damaged.\nThe second reason was that the fault line is not directed towards Greece but to Italy. The seismic energy moved towards the Adriatic and not to Ionian Sea and West Greece.\nThird reason is the epicenter and the focal depth prevented major disaster. The epicenter was 34km NW of Zakynthos near the junction of The Greek Arc, the focal depth at 10 km.\nAs the seismic activity continues with dozens of tremors 12 hours after the major earthquake at 1.54 a.m. and seismologists warn that another strong earthquake may occur, many locals do not dare to return to their homes, Greek media report."

    "text": "Washington State University and a Seattle-based biotech firm are suing each other over the right to grow and sell the highly anticipated Cosmic Crisp apple variety, which is expected to appear on store shelves early next year.\nThe legal dispute will determine whether Phytelligence – a company founded by a WSU professor that is partly owned by the university – can use its “cutting-edge science” to grow Cosmic Crisp buds and sell them to commercial apple producers.\nBut with millions of trees already planted across the state, the outcome of the dueling lawsuits seems unlikely to affect consumer availability of the Cosmic Crisp, a flavor-packed hybrid of the Honeycrisp and Enterprise varieties.\nBrandt said the Cosmic Crisp has the potential to displace other popular varieties in Washington’s $2.4 billion apple industry, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of U.S. production. And he said no other variety has been introduced to the market so rapidly. Producers typically plant new apples a little at a time to test consumer demand, but the Cosmic Crisp, which is said to have excellent sweetness and a remarkable shelf life, promises to be a hit.\nWSU researcher Bruce Barritt began developing the Cosmic Crisp about two decades ago. Until 2012, the year he filed for a patent, the tree was known only as WA 38.\nWSU professor Amit Dhingra founded Phytelligence in 2011 to commercialize a method of growing trees from tissue cultures rather than soil, which enables them to reach maturity and bear fruit in less time. Dhingra remains a WSU professor and the company’s chief science officer.\nIn 2012, Phytelligence entered into a “propagation agreement” with the university that allowed the company to cultivate WA 38 plants for research purposes. The agreement did not grant Phytelligence rights to the trademarked name Cosmic Crisp, but it did include an “option to participate as a provider and/or seller” once the apple went to market.\nIn February, Phytelligence filed suit in King County Superior Court, claiming the university had violated the agreement by refusing to issue a commercial license.\nWSU responded last month, claiming Phytelligence had not met clear requirements for obtaining a license and alleging the company had illegally sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to a grower near Yakima. The university also filed a patent-infringement claim in federal court.\nPhil Weiler, WSU’s vice president for marketing and communications, said the university must protect the “significant financial investment” it has made to develop the Cosmic Crisp by ensuring that no one grows the apple without proper licensing and quality-control measures in place.\n“The investments made by growers over the past two decades is at risk as well,” Weiler said.\nWSU claims it terminated its agreement with Phytelligence after the company handed over sales orders and invoices showing it sold 135,000 Cosmic Crisp trees to Evans Fruit Co. in April 2016. The university also demanded that Phytelligence destroy any Cosmic Crisp plant materials in its possession.\nPhytelligence has refused to do so.\n“We are not going to destroy the material because we feel it’s within our rights to get the license,” said Ken Hunt, the company’s CEO.\n“We don’t own land, so we used ground over at Evans, in large part because we thought we’d be using some of those buds to service their order,” he said.\nBut he insisted the move did not violate Phytelligence’s agreement with WSU or the university’s patent.\nHunt said Phytelligence has refunded payments to Evans Fruit, and the Cosmic Crisp budwood is back in Phytelligence’s possession.\nAs for the company’s efforts to obtain a license, Hunt said WSU required Phytelligence to become a member of the Northwest Nursery Improvement Institute, a nonprofit association of tree fruit nurseries, but the university would not provide clear requirements for doing so. NNII has the authority to license its members to grow the Cosmic Crisp.\nHunt suggested Phytelligence faced pushback because the company’s scientific approach can generate apples more quickly than the traditional nurseries, but Weiler, the WSU spokesman, said he was not aware of such competitive concerns. Weiler said several other companies managed to obtain commercial licenses without a problem.\n“For whatever reason, (Phytelligence) chose not to follow the path that was laid out in the agreement,” he said.\nThis is not the first time a WSU-bred apple has been the subject of litigation. The university also went to court with a Yakima fruit company that had been selling the WA 2 variety under the brand name Crimson Delight. The apple was recently rebranded as Sunrise Magic.\nIn any case, Weiler said, apple lovers should brace themselves for the Cosmic Crisp. Not only is it sweet and tangy, it can retain its flavor and texture for up to a year in storage, and it’s slow to brown after being sliced, he said."

    "text": "Shiva, the Limitless and His tranquil Trimbakeshwar!\nAsk me what intrigues me the most. My prompt reply would be ‘the transformer, the supreme concept of Lord Shiva‘. I feel that Shiva is there but no where. How simple, soft, compassionate, straight-forward and formless and yet so powerful, infinite and fascinating is He? He is an enigma.\nAsk me where I want to go all the time. In my mind there is this ancient stone Shiva temple tucked away in a deep forest and with a river burbling by its side, bringing me a whole lot of tranquility and inner peace taking me far from this tumultuous world. Yet, the question still remains. Can inner peace be achieved only by running away to a serene place? What is the idea of Shiva telling me..to run away or to flow with life? And I think, the answer is this simple – “Sometimes you have to disconnect to stay connected”.\nMy today’s post is about one of my most favourable places on this earth, the ancient Hindu Shiva Temple and one of the 12 Jyothirlingas, Trimbakeshwar.\nJyothirlinga, the infinite pillar of light means ‘The Radiant Sign of The Almighty Shiva‘. Trimbakeshwar is surrounded by three hills namely Brahmagiri, Nilagiri and Kalagiri. River Godavari originated in these hills and can be seen distantly from the Lord’s abode. A very serene place, it gets more verdant during monsoons. About the temple, read more here on wiki.\nIt is a very positive experience visiting Trimbakeshwar. You will be given yourself after the visit. You will be left with some new questions in mind and you will get some answers too. You will be left in a unique peaceful state of mind to continue your quest for the light. The simplicity and stillness of the place combined with the aura and holiness of the formless Jyothirlinga radiates good vibes and shows you the right direction.\nLet me be frank. I don’t get it when people say what’s in Grand Canyon except for the rock. Personally, I get very philosophical every time I visit it or think about it. May be it’s just me, as it is said ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder‘. So, here is my little ode to this magnificent natural wonder that awe-inspires me every single time I visit it.\nStanding royal, the Grand Canyon reiterates the power of nature to us. Every glance at its dimensions takes our breath away and each attempt to peruse it reminds us how tiny we are in this Universe. It inspires us to be undeterred by the trivial problems of life and to stand sentinel to protect ourselves and those who trust in us. Here is my Grand Salute, to The Grand Canyon!\nDo share links of your blogs on Grand Canyon, I would love to read!\nA happy day with the Arts People!\nLast weekend, as the sun shone bright, I reached the venue where I was supposed to volunteer as a Vendor Relief, and was so looking forward to it. With not many expectations in mind, I checked in to the Phoenix Festival of the Arts and took my badge and t-shirt.\nSpotting this mom-dotty duo who were volunteering at the entrance welcoming guests and just began to have their lunch, I took a quick chance to approach them and ask for their company as I was already starving. So, that’s how my day began, with very pleasant and welcoming lunch partners. Is this how life feels in a strange land, with strange people? Yeah, I think being in the company of total strangers is one of the nicest feelings in this world. No prejudices, no barriers, no opinions, no distances and no strings attached. We enjoyed lunch together while we spoke about what and why the volunteering, etc. Also, I got to see this Christmas Parade by some pretty children in the Fair Grounds.\nMy next stop was the beginning of my volunteering. So, this event was an Art Festival held by the Phoenix center for the Arts every year.\nFirst things first. Dressing up to the occasion. Well, it is definitely a choice, if you don’t want to. But, dressing appropriately to an occasion connects you to the event, puts you in the right mood and also changes the way people look at you which is important if you want to ‘connect’.\nSince it was an Art Festival, I decided to give an Ethnic touch to my ensemble by wearing a Red Cotton high-low kurti with white printed designs on it that I got in India paired with blue jeans. Wearing an Indian Kurti, when you are in an Art Festival on a Foreign land is for sure trendy and classy, and makes it look unique. I paired this attire with big cream colored Stone ear-hangings, and a knitted scarf to beat the cold in case. But, tee hee..once I got the volunteer t-shirt, I had to layer myself up with it that’s a different story though 😉 To perfectly complement the outfit, I carried my favorite Fossil Explorer Straw Cross Body Bag and wore my perfect colorful Mojdis bought in a craft expo in Hyderabad, India, though replaced them later with my comfy Crocs as my walking time increased. Ta da! Didnt I pretty much nail the outfit?\nMy first stop was this booth where a lady was exhibiting her hand made jewelry. Call it an act of Universe or not, a particular blue resin pendant caught my attention and it had etched on it, Dancing Ganesha with eight arms. I am a Hindu, and all our prayers and Pujas first begin with praying to Lord Ganesh. You can read more about the significance here. Isn’t it interesting that you are alone on a strange land, with complete strangers around you and how the Universe makes you feel that you are still connected and belonged. I asked her if she needed a reliever, to which she said No and then we had a brief conversation about her beautiful jewelry creations. It was a fun start!\nMoving on further, I found this very creative artist Kelly, who is a graphic designer and also creates her own designs and prints. Her designs were beautiful and after discussing about both of our interests and goals in life, what and how etc, I watched her booth for a while and she took a quick break. This meeting is so special to me because of late I was looking for some answers regarding Graphic Design and related fields, and voila I get to meet with this awesome artist specialized in the same field! Visit her website here to know more about her works.\nAs I kept walking further down the aisles, the talent and creativity of the various artists and artisans enthralled me and the variety of stalls that lined up amazed me. The diversity of arts included Pottery, Canvas Paintings, Glass Art, Hand Made Jewelry, Homemade Bath and Body Products, Arts and crafts made of Recycled metal, Handmade bags, Custom Printed T-shirts, Pashmina Scarves, and what not! There was live music and food trucks served up delicious warm food. Kids played around in merriment. It was a fun-filled warm sunny Saturday.\nIn another brief meeting, I met this lovely couple from Berrie Creative who were selling their unique and creative vibrant colored lampshades made of glass and wire. And I did not know that a small conversation with them would give me a hope for a life-time! They told me how to never give up on an interest and keep experimenting. Trust me, I have never seen such creative glass art in my life. The lamp shades were mesmerizing.\nLater, I relieved a couple of artists so that they have their lunch. They were very kind and appreciated me for helping them out. Isn’t is wonderful when people realize your effort and good intentions and respond back to you positively. Ohh, what would I do without all these beautiful people in my life!\nMy next stop was Reflections in Metal, a unique art handcrafted out of rolled steel. Their display had amazing pieces of art and in quite large numbers. The vendors were so welcoming and were explaining well about their art to the guests. I couldn’t remember their names, but after talking about their work I took a photograph with them which made them very happy. And when I waved them Goodbye and Merry Christmas, the eldest gentleman of the two stopped me and gifted me a Metal Cross that was among the items being sold! Wow! What was that! Does affection and appreciation has any bounds? I was so elated, particularly when someone fondly gifted me a Cross, and that too during Christmas season…like I always believe, connections don’t happen without a reason. Now, this Cross is in my Puja room along with the other Gods. I am Hindu, and what Hinduism teaches is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. It is a Sanskrit phrase found in Hindu texts such as the Maha Upanishad, which means “The world is one family”, and I believe in it.\nA special mention is needed about ‘Paintings by the disabled’ stall. All the paintings were unbelievably lively and excellent! We bought a miniature Canvas Painting of the Prickly Pear Cactus.\nTowards the end, my family joined me in the festival. They enjoyed live music and chilled out on the lawn watching Muralists painting murals under the warm winter sun. The whole environment was fun and frolic lifting up spirits.\nAnd then while finishing up my shift, I met Amelie. With a calm face and a gorgeous smile, she invited me to her booth. Her paintings were so full of life, spirituality and love. I am so glad I got to know her and could make friends with her. Visit her website here to see more of her brilliant and life-changing artwork.\nFinally, I wrapped up my evening at the festival by taking my family around. My son goofed around all the while and really enjoyed each and every aspect of it. There were these folks from circus entertaining kids and adults alike, walking around the place.\nWe came back home after purchasing a lamp shade and a face balm from Flower Song Soaps.The lampshade now lights up our Puja/Meditation room. Every time I see the lamp, I remember that lovely couple, their smiles and the encouragement they gave me. I am using the face balm daily post scrubbing my face, and it gives me the perfect moisturizing for Arizonan winters along with an exquisite fragrance.\nSo whenever I say I believe in Fairy tales, I mean it. Look what all this love gave me in the middle of an ordinary life – in deed a Fairy tale!\nThank you Phoenix Festival of the Arts for having me and thank you for everything. These moments will be cherished forever.\nOn a final note, I would like to appeal to you, please encourage and appreciate handcrafts and local made.\nDochu La & Chele La – Bhutan’s sacred mountain passes!\nBhutan’s Thimpu and Bhutan’s Paro.\nIn this post, I am going to brief about our trip to Bhutan’s sacred mountain passes, Dochu La and Chele La.\nWhen mountains call you, there are no excuses. There is a reason behind it, a purpose behind it. And what do the mountains tell us? To stand still and strong against the blustering winds. Mountains are unyielding protectors, they show us the righteous way of life. They inspire us with their patience and perseverance. They are unconquerable, but they leave the passes for us, humans to go closer to them, and reach them for the fillip. I witnessed the same kind of spirit going closer to the holy Himalayas during our Bhutan trip! We visited Dochu La and Chele La, the two mountains passes in the Himalayas of Bhutan.\nLocated at an elevation of 3,100 metres, Dochu La is located on the road from Thimpu to Punakha. To the east of the pass, the snow clad mountain peaks of the Himalayas are seen prominently and among them is the Mt. Masanggang at 7,158 metres (23,484 ft) which is the highest peak in Bhutan, known in local language as the Mt. Gangkar Puensum. The road further runs into the scenic Punakha valley.\nThe environment is calm and religious, with 108 memorial chortens called the Druk Wangyal Chortens built by Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuk, the eldest Queen Mother. There is a monastery called the Druk Wangyal Lhakhang (temple), built in honor of the fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Also, there is the country’s first Royal Botanical Park located adjacent to the chortens. While this whole scene on the pass is a colorful feast to the eyes, the backdrop is often claded with a moving blanket of fog obscuring and revealing the Himalayas along with the near-by verdant greens leaving your mind and soul in tranquility.\nIt is an indelible experience for me to meditate inside and outside the Lhakhang overlooking the Himalayas.\nChele La Pass is one of the highest motorable passes in Bhutan. It is the highest point with an altitude of 3988 metres. The road to Chele La is flanked by dense forests, and the trip to reach the pass takes you on a non-stop jaunt. Chele La, unlike Dochu La is very jagged and is surrounded by hilly terrains covered with vegetation that changes colors with seasons. The pass roughened by the cold gusts signifies a different side of Mother nature. Colorful prayer flags can be seen fluttering on the rough slopes making the view bright and pleasant. On a clear day, there are spectacular views of Mt. Jumolhari, Jichu Drake and adjoining peaks to the North West, as well as the view of the beautiful Haa and Paro valley.\n‘The best dreams happen when you are awake’! And yes, my dream to feel closer to the Himalayas came true this way. I will await to witness this heavenly experience once again in my lifetime.\nSo, did the mountains ever call you? If yes, please leave a comment and tell me all about it. I would love to connect with like-minds.\nThank you for reading. More on our interactions and conversations with folks in Bhutan, and why I think Bhutan qualifies for a happy country in the upcoming posts. Stay tuned, and stay connected. See you later!\nBhutan – The Kingdom of Happiness. (Part 2) In and around Paro!\nI hope you have read about our Bhutan travel experiences in my previous blog here. Now, I am going to share with you more details of our itinerary.\nAfter spending in and around the charming Capital city of Bhutan, Thimpu, we moved to Paro for a two day tour. Along with being a picturesque city, Paro is a historic town with structures with traditional architecture. It is also home for Bhutan’s only international airport, Paro Airport.\nThe main attractions in the city tour of Paro are Rinpung Dzong, Paro Taktsang, Kyichu Lhakhang, National Museum of Bhutan, Paro Airport bird’s eye view and the shopping streets of Paro.\nWith history beginning in the 15th century, Rinpung Dzong is a large Buddhist Monastery and a fortress that now has various administrative offices of Paro within it. Outside of the Dzong is the Deyangkha Temple and inside are fourteen shrines and chapels. It is quite interesting to go around the Dzong and to soak in all the historical and cultural significance. Below are a few photographs taken in the Dzong.\nParo Taktsang, the very famous Himalayan sacred monastery is perched on the cliffs of upper Paro Valley. It can be reached either through a trek, or a horseback ride. Guru Padmasambhava who brought Buddhism to Bhutan is believed to have meditated there for three years, three months, three weeks, three days and three hours in the 8th century. The monastery has a rich and very significant history related to Bhutan and Buddhism. Read more about the world famous heritage site here.\nThe Jowo Temple of Kyichu is one of the oldest temples in Bhutan, originally built in the 7th century by the Tibetan Emperor Songtsän Gampo. Read more about it on wiki here.\nThe museum of Bhutan documents the cultural dances, flora and fauna, and other historical facts of Bhutan. There is a video played in the museum showcasing the different Bhutanese dances and festivals and their significance. It is quite fascinating to go round the museum. Aerial view of Paro valley from the museum offers breath-taking vistas. Photograph below.\nParo Airport is undoubtedly one of the world’s very scenic airports. Nestled in a gorgeous panorama and in a deep valley is the airport adjacent to the banks of River Paro Chhu. The whole scene is fabulous and it stays with you forever.\nLast but not the least, shopping! What fun is it when you do world travel and not collect souvenirs? Here is my Bhutan travel haul. I bought most of these things on the street bazaar of Paro. They are going to keep all the memories alive to me.\nBhutan – The Kingdom of Happiness (Part 1). In and around Thimpu!\nA few years ago, the topics during a tea-time confab were Gross Happiness Index, Bhutan, Himalayas and Taktsang Monastery. Like a seed planted grows into a tree, this discussion intrigued me a lot and my fascination to witness the Bhutanese way of living increased by the day. All the enthralling aspects of Bhutan and my all time obsession with nature, and mountains in particular, I added Bhutan travel to my bucket list.\nCome 2016, life showed a direction towards pursuing my travel dream. And yes, I visited Bhutan, the Kingdom of Happiness.\nPristine landscapes, spectacular views, amicable people and their spiritual way of life, rich heritage, comforting food, and everything else so heavenly qualify Bhutan for a Utopia. Nestled in the Eastern Himalayas, Bhutan is full of never-ending range of hills, verdant plains, meandering perennial rivers, meditative sounds of the Buddhist chants and colorful prayer flags tied everywhere reminding us that nature and spirituality are inseparable.\nThough the pictures don’t do justice to the real beauty of this paradise, and my words can’t describe the magical experience, I shall try my best to give a brief of how and what it was. Our tour was of four days covering the two major cities of Bhutan, Thimpu and Paro. A further long stay will give you much time and opportunity to explore the country better.\nThe Memorial Chorten or Memorial Stupa was built in the honor of the third King of Bhutan Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. It does not contain human remains, but just a photograph of the King. It is circumambulated in clockwise direction like other religious structures. We spent about an hour in the Chorten witnessing the annual recitation of ‘Seven Line Prayer’ to Guru Rinpochhe. The whole milieu was sacred and ingenuous.\nWe later visited the Great Buddha Dordenma, a 169ft gigantic Buddha statue and the Takin Preserve. Takin is the national animal of Bhutan.\nRest of city tour had viewing gorgeous vistas and visiting the important places of interest like Changlimithing multi-purpose national stadium, National Institute for Zorig Chusum (Arts and Crafts school), Authentic Bhutanese Crafts Bazaar, National Library of Bhutan etc.\nNational Institute for Zorig Chusum trains the Bhutanese youth in 13 native and traditional Bhutanese arts like wood carving, statue-making, painting, weaving, tailoring, embroidery etc. Some of the finished products are also sold for good prices.\nThe shops had a unique collection of handcrafted house decors, clothes, book marks, key chains, Bhutanese masks, Bhutanese musical instruments, hand bags, jewelry and many more. The place was a kaleidoscope of colors.\nTashichhoedzong build by the first Dharma Raja, is a Buddhist monastery and fortress on the banks of Wang Chu River. There are thirty temples, chapels and shrines within it. It is the office of Bhutan’s civil government and Kingship together. A few kms near the Dzong is the King’s palace, the Dechencholing Palace. The photograph below is an aerial view of the Dzong and its surroundings.\nComing to cuisine, red rice and buckwheat are Bhutan’s two main foods. Red rice in Bhutan has an earthy flavor. The Bhutanese make soups and stews out of various vegetables and meats (yak meat being a specialty). Ema datshi, which is their national dish, is spicy made with large, green chili peppers in a cheesy sauce. It is one of their major comforting and widely made dishes. Momos (dumplings) are also quite famous. Butter Tea (also called Suja) is made of the Bhutanese Tea Leaves, Water, Butter and salt. The Bhutanese also include various spices like ginger, garlic, turmeric, caraway etc in their cooking.\nThe National game of Bhutan is Dha or Archery. We made sure we wore the traditional dresses of Bhutan (Gho for men and Kira for women) and played archery amidst the serene hilly terrains.\nTraditional Architecture remains prevalent in Bhutan. Throughout its history, Bhutan has mainly followed the Tibetan tradition of Buddhist architecture. Any new structure construction is supposed to abide the rules. Read more on the Architecture of Bhutan in wiki here.\nTouring Bhutan is not only a way to escape in the tranquility of nature, but also a fun trip getting to know their unique culture and tradition. It opens your heart to simplicity, variety and spirituality.\nRevive your body and awaken your soul, go visit this magical Kingdom.\nMore on the remaining itinerary in next blogs. I will take through our Paro city tour and the sacred mountainous passes.\nMonsoons remind me of Visakhaptnam aka Vizag, my home town. I have lived all my childhood waking up to a kaleidoscope of greens, thanks to my dad, an ardent nature lover who thought we should live as close to nature as possible.\nMonsoons in Vizag bring a burst of vibrancy and a splash of lush green to an already verdant view. Our home being at foot hill of the Eastern Ghats and a bit sloped, we experience lovely and fresh water streams gushing on a heavy rainfall day. The sight of monsoon clouds hovering over the majestic hills shrouding and revealing them is in deed salubrious.\nAnd oh, not to forget the tiny pools of water collected on our terrace top, I remember jumping into them and splashing water all over myself. All those little birdies singing at the top of their voice and, freshest flowers and leaves with rain droplets raise your spirits high and make you live in the moment.\nOver time I have captured these scenes in my camera and though they don’t do justice to the beauty of this rainy paradise, they keep these special memories alive. So well, I have a lot of rainy tales to tell, but for now please enjoy viewing these photographs."

I walked in class and didn't see her. All possibility of me being happy that day was gone in an instant. I at down and put my head down. And class started but I didn't care. I just kept my head down and zoned out. And suddenly I felt the slightest touch run across my shoulder and down my back. I looked up to see her the girl and a smile came upon my face. I was over joyed. Now all I wanted was for lunch to come. Fourth period couldn't have been any longer. Lunch had finally come and I saw her at the table I sat down and looked at her I saw the cutest smile. And I said hi she said hello I asked her what's your name Ashely. I told her mine and she smiled. We talked and everyday at lunch. I was so happy being friends with her until one say when in she walked on my bus and sat next to me I said what are you doing she said I thought we could chill after school today. I only I can find a way out to stay away from home."

    "text": "HARTFORD, MICHIGAN (July 28, 2017) – After a tough visit to Canada, the JJR Marshall Racing #41 team trekked back into the State as they found themselves in Michigan for the next scheduled event on the World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series event at Hartford Speedway. There were 27 speed competitors lined up in the pit area at the half-mile oval where Shane Stewart waved the checkered flag last year when the tour starts visited for the Battle of Michigan.\nJeremy Schultz, from Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, kicked off time trials as he revved his engine and turned in two good laps around the surface at Hartford. Jason Johnson was already ready in the staging area as he would be the fifth car to push off in time trials aboard the Fischer Body Shop/Kenny’s Components #41 Maxim. David Gravel had raised the bar with a lap of 13.731 seconds, so the Ragin’ Cajun summoned the horses from his Kistler Engines powerplant to get going. The ponies were at full gallop when he took the green flag and his first lap was a good one at 13.855 seconds, which was second quick. He stayed on the hammer and turned in a consistent, but slightly slower, second lap coming in at 13.863 seconds. As he patiently waited for the remaining 22 drivers to complete their laps, the forty-one remained on the board as the second quickest when the final checker flag flew.\nEarning the pole position in the second heat race, Philip and the JJR Marshall Racing team went to work to ready the Maxim Racing machine for battle in the eight lap races where the top two go to the Craftsman Club Dash and four more lock into the A-Main. The cars lined up in their traditional two-by-two order with Jeremy Schultz sharing the front row with the Ragin’ Cajun as Brad Sweet, Logan Schuchart, Joe Swanson, Ryan Ruhl, Chad Blonde, Max McGhee and Jason Steinebach rounding out the starting order, When the green flag dropped Jason drove into the lead in his Dissolvalloy Downhole Revolution/Weld Racing entry with Brad Sweet pressing him for the position. Sweet would eventually wrestle it away as Jason was now giving chase with Schuchart running in the show position. Sweet would take the win with Jason coming home second to earn the two spots in the Craftsman Club Dash as Schuchart, Schultz, Ruhl and Blonde secured the final four transfer spots to the feature.\nThere were six drivers who earned a spot in the 6-lap Craftsman Club Dash at Harford Speedway and Jason Johnson was one of them along with heat race winners David Gravel, Brad Sweet, and Shane Stewart and fellow runner-up finishers Paul McMahan and Jason Sides. An inversion pill of four was pulled which put the driver of the forty-one in the Priority Aviation Services, LLC/Valvoline machine on the inside of row three in the fifth starting position with Jason Sides to the right side of his nerf bar. Polesitter Paul McMahan and fellow front row starter Shane Stewart brought the field to the green with Stewart getting to the clean air first. Jason was running sixth as the dirty air churned with Stewart collecting the win over Sweet, Gravel, Sides and McMahan with Jason claiming the final spot.\nThere were 30 laps left to race on this night as the track was slicking off and becoming a very technical and tactical surface for the competitors. After the WoO traditional four wide salute to the fans it was time to go racing in Jakob Weaver’s home state of Michigan. Brad Sweet jumped into the lead, but here came the Ragin’ Cajun using what he could find on the topside of the track. He made his way all the way up to second before the traction wore away and he started to get shuffled back in the running order. He ran in the top five for the first third of the race and was just outside looking in over the next ten laps. Enduring numerous cautions and one red flag stoppage the teams were searching for ways to get a hold of the track while positioning themselves to make a passed versus being passed. If you gave up the bottom line you were exposed. Gravel briefly took the lead from Sweet on laps 9 and 10 before Sweet drove the NAPA Auto Parts #49 back into the top spot. Gravel would reclaim the lead on lap 28 and collect the win over Sweet, Schuchart, and Brent Marks with Kraig Kinser driving home fourth. Jason hung on to gather an eleventh-place finish in the Waco Metal/Jonestown KOA #41, his 43rd Top 15 finish of the season – an impressive 72.88% success rate, as the team will now head to Wilmot Raceway for action on Saturday night."

    "text": "When the Indian Mutiny broke out in May 1857, Hall was on HMS Shannon en route to China. She was intercepted and ordered to Calcutta (since renamed Kolkata). A Shannon Brigade was formed of several gunners, sailors, and marines, under Captain William Peel. The ship was towed over 600 miles up the Ganges River to Allahabad. Then the force fought across country to Campbell’s headquarters at Cawnpore and were in time to take part in the Siege of Lucknow.\nLieutenant (now Commander) Young, late Gunnery Officer of Her Majesty’s ship ” Shannon,” and William Hall, “Captain of the Foretop,” of that Vessel, were recommended by the late Captain Peel for the Victoria Cross, for their gallant conduct at a 24-Pounder Gun, brought up to the angle of the Shah Nujeff, at Lucknow, on the 16th of November, 1857.\nWilliam Edward Hall was born at Summerville, Nova Scotia, in 1827 as the son of Jacob and Lucy Hall, who had escaped American slave owners in Maryland during the War of 1812 and were brought to freedom in Nova Scotia by the British Royal Navy as part of the Black Refugee movement. The Halls first lived in Summerville, NS where Jacob worked in a shipyard operated by Abraham Cunard until they bought a farm across the Avon River at Horton Bluff. Hall first worked in shipyards at nearby Hantsport, Nova Scotia, before going to sea at the age of seventeen. He sailed first on merchant ships based out of the Minas Basin including the barque Kent of Kentville, Nova Scotia.\nHall is buried in Hantsport, Nova Scotia where his grave is marked by a monument at the Baptist church. The Royal Canadian Legion in Hantsport is named “The Lucknow Branch” in honour of his Victoria Cross action. Hall’s Victoria Cross was repatriated from Britain in 1967 by the government of Nova Scotia and is on permanent display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. Hall is also featured in exhibits at the Halifax Citadel and at the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia.\n?Canada Post commemorated William Hall on a stamp, first issued on February 1, 2010 in Hantsport, Nova Scotia and officially launched at the Black Cultural Centre on February 2, 2010. Hall was designated a Nationally Historic Person by the Canadian Historic Sites and Monuments Board at Hantsport on October 8, 2010 and a new plaque was unveiled in his honour."

    "text": "Could a chatbot solve the retirement savings problem?\nBut according to a paper by behavioral economist Schlomo Benartzi, a Professor of Behavioral Decision Making at UCLA Anderson School of Management and a senior academic advisor to the Voya Institute for Behavioral Finance Innovation, when a chatbot and text messages, as well as targeted e-mails, are combined with the principles of behavioral economics—specifically, nudging people into certain actions—the effects on retirement savings can be substantial.\nDigital nudging has two advantages over conventional methods of encouraging people to change their behavior.\nFirst, research can be conducted far faster in the digital space, which helps to identify successful strategies more quickly.\nAnd second, the scale of a digital program can be immense, which results in far more people being affected in a cost-effective manner.\nThey also looked at robo-savings apps as a means of counteracting how easy it is to spend money online via one-click checkouts and apps like Apple Pay by helping people to save money just as easily.\nOne method that sought to increase enrollment in an auto-deposit program posed the question to users of whether they’d prefer to save $5 per day, $35 per week or $150 per month.\nWhile just 7 percent opted to save $150 per month, which is essentially the same as $5 per day or $35 per week, a full 30 percent opted for the smaller-sounding, easier-sounding $5 per day.\nThen there’s mobile feedback. Testing a mobile app that provides a dashboard showing people “how much you spend at clothing stores and the percentage of income that’s devoted to paying off the mortgage” while they’re actually out spending money “turned out to have a huge impact,” particularly on discretionary spending, “with the average user decreasing their monthly spending by 15.7 percent”—nearly all of which was discretionary spending, such as eating out.\nSo as research progresses in both behavioral economics and tech tools that can help people better manage their money, retirement savings may come out a winner in the end.\nThis article was written by BenefitsPro and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network."

    "text": "I enjoyed this book. The descriptions were fantastic. I actually listened to the story as an audiobook narrated by Steve West. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fantasy novel in young adult genres that have a bit of an in-depth love story to the plot. Steve West was also an amazing narrator so I would definitely recommend any audiobooks by him.\nThe author Laini Taylor was amazing at descriptors. The way the scenes and characters were illustrated through her creative writing artistry added so much richness and depth. The imagery was where she was able to shine through her writing talents. They were really the heart and soul of the story. Some descriptions seemed to be taken right out of the book of Revelation which was interesting. There was flowery prose that added value and appeal to the beauty of the writing. I don’t know how it would read though because there were quite a few characters to keep track of with similar pursuits and agendas that would probably be slow and boring to read about, so I’d definitely recommend the audiobook book by Steve West because his ability to bring diversity and life to each character.\nI enjoyed the first third of the book the most. After about chapter 18-22, the focus was more on relational development, as in sensual romance that I felt was more about dialectical tensions through a less flowery dialogue between the main characters with glorification of over-the-top eroticism and ‘imperfect situations.’ The very definition of insta-love that is found in a lot of YA fiction. And later there was an introduction of other antagonists and sub characters that also fell in similar circumstance and persona that felt a bit repetitive rather than supportive for the main plot. Basically I just wanted to live in the first third because it was my favorite part.\n“In the western outposts of the Elmuthaleth-Alkonost and others-they watched for the heat-distorted silhouettes of camel trains to energy from the emptiness as they always had, but they did not."

    "text": "It was early on a recent Saturday morning, and Michael Amend had been on the road for hours, picking up players in a church bus in Greensboro and High Point. He hoped the other volunteer drivers weren’t having trouble finding players’ homes, but he didn’t want to talk on the phone while driving.\nThe morning’s route and the games that followed comprised a handful of the 25 hours a week Amend spends organizing and coaching soccer teams for students and alumni of the Doris Henderson Newcomers School in Greensboro. And this year his new team of 11- and 12-year-olds has meant an additional workload.\nElsewhere in Greensboro, Moussa Issifou received texts and emails — inquiries for that evening’s game held at a field near Falkener Elementary. Issifou came to Greensboro from Togo in September 2000. Now he’s a professor at NC A&T University, but in the 17 years since his arrival, he has also worked to bring the international community together through soccer — all while enduring unfamiliar restrictions, costs and predispositions.\nNarayan Khadka spent the same morning using art to teach English and US citizenship at Greensboro’s Glen Haven Community Center — a welcoming space for support and education located among the apartments of dozens of refugee and immigrant families near North Elm Street and Pisgah Church Road. Khadka arrived in Greensboro from Nepal, and in the years since has pursued an education that would help him unite people and resolve differences. He was waiting to hear about a grant from the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro to revitalize the city’s international soccer league; he was the president during its only season back in 2012. There had been many inquiries by those who want it back — people who said they needed it.\nThese three organizers of immigrant and refugee soccer matches in Greensboro strive to maintain traditions, to do their part for something that endures so strongly in themselves and those they care for, but that the world around them endangers.\nThey want to provide something hard to define, but for many of the participants, it’s something akin to feeling wholly alive. Their players seek respite, connection, tradition, home. They find it in soccer.\nThese are the local stewards of the beautiful game.\nAs the sun went down on April 4, it cast an amber light on the Bennett College soccer field that borders Gate City Boulevard. Almost 20 players had arrived, but the field was empty. Puddles of that morning’s rain kept them off.\nInstead, the young men in their late teens kicked soccer balls around on a basketball court next to the soggy field. The hoops and backboards have been removed, leaving only the metal posts — monuments to past play.\nMost of the players wore no shoes, not wanting to ruin cleats on the court’s hard surface. Playing barefoot was nothing new; it’s how many of them learned the game in their home countries from a young age, sometimes playing for five or six hours a day. Without cleats on, they still showed incredible finesse.\nCoach Michael Amend watched the players, who make up the Greensboro United Soccer Association’s Global team. They are alumni of the Newcomers School, a magnet for first-year immigrants and refugees. Students remain at the Newcomers School for one year, then transition to various schools in the district.\nAs the players scrimmaged in two separate games in teams of three or four, Anas Quashie limped off the court, the sole of his foot bleeding onto the asphalt. He found one of his socks and wrapped it tightly around the wound.\nAfter the practice, as players waited for city buses or rides home from Amend and one another, Quashie’s peers chided him.\n“You must not be from Africa, bro!” one kidded in good nature, showing the group the callous bottom of his right foot.\nQuashie is from Africa. He used to play what he calls “street soccer” in the dirt roads of Togo. His feet have softened, adapted since he moved to Greensboro in February 2016.\nOf the many challenges that a young refugee faces in the United States, the ones related to changes in soccer are often no less significant than ones off the field. Playing soccer sustains many of these young men: The game transcends to become symbolic — a connection to a new home and the reminder of an old one.\nQuashie said the hardest adjustment in his soccer life has been the difference between the dirt streets of Togo and the large grass fields in Greensboro. The game itself has changed.\nSoccer encompasses the cultural differences that all of the young men face. They’ve come from other traditions in Egypt, Congo, El Salvador, Liberia, Iraq and various other countries around the world.\nQuashie’s teammate Makryous Kori misses the sand pitches in Sudan, where he grew up. He misses using rocks to mark the goals, and he misses his friends who he occasionally talks with on the phone, who ask him when he’s coming home.\nBut there are greater differences than a change in the playing surface, and a new prerequisite toward practices and matches might be the most challenging.\n“You have to call people in the US to [arrange a time] to play,” Kori explained. In Sudan, he said, everyone played in the streets all day long. Pickup soccer was as much a part of life as anything else.\nAs refugees acclimate to life in Greensboro, to fresh traditions at the Newcomers School and beyond, changes are inevitable.\nThe weekly pickup game began before Moussa Issifou arrived, but he was by no means lost or out of luck. His group formed these sides often, and he knew the rule: If you’re married, you’re on one team; if not, you’re on the other.\nThe division might not have been followed precisely, and the teams were already unbalanced — 11 bachelors against 13 espoused, with Issifou joining the latter. But for Issifou, accuracy carried less importance than a greater goal. He didn’t call them married and unmarried. He called them fathers and sons.\nUnderstandably, the sons want to beat their fathers — the adults or elders. But just as importantly for Issifou, they simply want to play.\nSoccer is a tradition — a fact lost to those who don’t include sports in the ranks of language, food, music and dance. Yet like any part of culture, a community’s athletic and sports traditions can falter as the youngest generations of families new to the United States adjust.\nFathers and sons face off at a field near Falkener Elementary in a game Moussa Issifou helped organize.\nAfter the separate sides warmed up — the fathers as a synchronized regiment and the sons in a loose circle of chatter — the sons removed their shirts and the game began.\nPlayers on the field usually range from around 15 to 50. In special circumstances, the fathers allow the even younger kids to join.\nThis wasn’t the case on April 16. As the big game got underway, some of the youngest kids started a miniature match in an unused corner of the field, while others tore around the parking lot on bikes with training wheels or partook in a large box of Bojangles fast food.\nSometimes when Issifou plays, memories of his own younger days appear."

This year, however, we have increased the quota as there are six apprentices to be taken on. In a workforce of 45 employees that is a very high percentage.\n“We normally have about eight apprentices on the production floor at the same time. As of 2012 we will have 14. In 1995 we first appointed a dedicated trainer for apprentices and that is all this one particular supervisor does.\n“His supervision range is very high because our boys progress quite rapidly and training is intense because most of our equipment is CNC rather than manual.\nLeussink Engineering’s business is fairly unique as it is focused on quite small batch quantities – often as small as a single item.\nAttention to scheduling and inventory combined with highly trained apprentices ensures these cost effective tiny runs are viable for clients.\n“With a plethora of highly trained CNC-savvy young staff on the production floor, we have that solid background to produce these once-off items for a good price and quality because we do it all the time and are very good at it,” says Mr Leussink.\n“We have made a lot of refinement to the apprentice selection process over the last five years and over that time we’ve had about 80-100 applicants per intake.\n“Our record is excellent, Mr Leussink says. “We retain about 90% of our trained apprentices and our employee age profile is very young. We see these as very strong signs for not just our company but Australian industry in general."

My father-in-law said the other day, in reference I think to the warning on the inside of our car door that tells you you might hit your head on it, that 'there is a dangerous trend towards safety'. We had one child (and yes, sad) die on a school trip in a swimming pool when my youngest was in grade 5 - not at our school, or even from our home city, or in our province - and the principal of our school made a rule that no kid could go within 60 feet of the edge of any water. Made our trip to Pioneer Village on the St Lawrence a real hoot. 10's of thousands of kids from Ontario go to Quebec for school trips, and vice versa (because nous parlons le francais, le bas) and they all swim in pools every year. My kid skate boards - and I hate this - he simply won't wear a helmet. Now I could 'make' him, and then he would take it off once he was around the corner. I could take away his skate board - yeah - that would really help him - he lives to snowboard and skateboard - and his marks are great. I could take away his skateboard and he could get hit by an asteroid. When they made better hockey equipment the game got more vicious as well - so minimizing risk maximizes risky behaviour - always a trade off.\nso... what's up with all those red candle sticks on the metal charts?\ndoes the EE know that I'll have lots of cash coming in next week?

    "text": "On 9 June 1572, Jeanne d’Albret, the queen of Navarre died.\nNavarre was a small, Pyrenean kingdom, nestled between France and Spain, and fiercely holding on to its independence in the face of these two great powers. Jeanne was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in France on 16 November 1528 and was a relation of the French royal family through her mother, the sister of François I. Her husband, Antoine de Bourbon, was a prince of the blood and spent most of his life torn between his conflicting loyalties to France and Navarre.\nJeanne inherited the throne from her father, Henri II in 1555. She had been raised a Huguenot (French Calvinist Protestant) and on her accession, declared Protestantism the official religion of Navarre. She was very clever and a shrewd politician. She was well educated and, taking after her mother, Marguerite of Navarre, she was a writer. Jeanne composed and published numerous poems.\nPious and staunchly Protestant, Jeanne was suspicious when, in 1570, plans were formed to marry her son and heir, Henri de Navarre, to Marguerite de Valois (Margot), the daughter of Henri II of France and Catherine de’ Medici. Catherine hoped to bring peace to France, which was again on the brink of a religious civil war, with the wedding. Jeanne suspected a trap but was keen to see her son make such an advantageous marriage.\nTwo months before the marriage was scheduled to take place, Jeanne died suddenly in Paris. Rumour was rife that Catherine de’ Medici had had her poisoned. Shortly before her death, Jeanne had supposedly received a gift of scented gloves from Catherine’s infamous perfumier, René the Florentine. René was famed for his Italian perfumes and cosmetics, but widely suspected of being the maker of the poisons the queen mother allegedly used to dispatch her enemies.\nThe marriage went ahead on 18 August 1572, with horrific consequences.\nThis entry was posted in Henri de Navarre, Infamous Women, Jeanne d'Albret, Marguerite of Navarre and tagged Catherine de' Medici, France, henri de navarre, history, History of Europe on June 9, 2011 by Gillian.\nOn 5th January 1589, Catherine de’ Medici, the Queen Mother of France died at Blois, possibly of pleurisy. She was 69 years old and had spent the last thirty years fighting to keep the French throne in the hands of her sons, three of whom succeeded their father, Catherine’s husband Henri II, to be king of France.\nCatherine had arrived in France from her native Italy in 1534. Pope Clement VII (who famously refused to give Henry VIII his divorce from Catherine of Aragon), her uncle, had used his wealth and power to arrange a most illustrious marriage for her. She was descended from the Medici family but though they had been important in Florence, bankers could rarely expect to marry princes. However, Francis I of France had depleted his treasury in the pursuit of land and glory the Italian Wars and the handsome dowry which Clement promised to send with Catherine, along with an alliance with the Pope, meant that Francis was willing to overlook Catherine’s less-than-ideal pedigree.\nThat said, Catherine did have a small amount of royal blood. Her mother, Madeleine was related, fairly distantly, to the French crown. Sadly for Catherine, she never knew Madeleine as she had died only a few days after her daughter’s birth. It is thought that she had contracted syphilis from her womanising husband Lorenzo. Within a couple of weeks, he too succumbed and Catherine was left an orphan.\nThe young girl was raised initially in Florence with relatives and later in Rome, under the care of her uncle the Pope. She was intelligent, witty and lively but never described as a great beauty. Luckily for her, her family wealth and influence would go some way towards making up for such a defect. Many female failings could be compensated for with a heavy enough purse. Various matches were suggested for Catherine but it was the one with Francis I’s second son, Henri Duc d’Orleans, which went to fruition. As the second son, Henri was not expected to become king and so Francis was content to marry him off to the banking heiress.\nAged 14, Catherine set sail for France and was welcomed to Marseilles with great festivity. Soon after her arrival she and Henri married in a lavish ceremony. Henri was a withdrawn youth, scarred by his time as a hostage in Spain. He proved to be a polite and dutiful husband but his affection lay with his long-term mistress, the vampish Diane de Poitiers. Though Henri was distant and disinterested in his plain little wife, Catherine adored him.\nPredictably enough, the marriage was troubled and Catherine and Henri’s lack of heir compounded the problem, especially after Henri’s elder brother died making him next in line to the throne. Catherine was in danger of being repudiated and replaced with a more fertile wife (the assumption being that infertility was the woman’s “fault,” particularly after at least two of Henri’s mistresses gave birth to his children.\nCatherine reputedly tried all manner of superstitious solutions to her infertility. Eventually, after some medical intervention (the exact nature of which is shrouded in mystery), Catherine finally conceived after ten years of fruitless marriage. She went on to produce ten children in the following ten years, of whom three daughters and four sons survived infancy. Of those sons, three would become king of France.\nAs dauphine and then queen, mother to the heirs of France, Catherine still enjoyed all but no influence over her beloved husband. Instead, Henri discussed matters of state with Diane and it was with her that wise courtiers curried favour, not the dowdy foreign queen. Diane even encouraged Henri to visit his wife’s chambers in order to have more children with her but after the delivery of twin girls (both of whom died) in 1556 almost cost Catherine her life, she was advised not to attempt to bear more children. Henri therefore never slept with her again.\nIn 1559 tragedy struck when Henri was injured in a joust. His opponent’s lance shattered on his visor, sending shards through the king’s eye. After several days of agony, Henri died with Catherine at his side. Catherine took her revenge on Diane by barring her from attending to Henri as he lay dying, calling for his mistress. She then ordered that Diane was to return all the jewels that Henri had given her during their long relationship, claiming that they were crown jewels and not Diane’s to keep. She then banished her from court.\nUnfortunately for the queen, her grief (for the rest of her life she rarely wore any colour other than black) and desire to extract a petty revenge caused her to miss the more important opportunity which had presented itself. Her eldest son Francis had acceded to the throne on Henri’s death. As Francis was only fifteen years old, a regent had to be appointed. Typically, the Queen Mother would take on this role however Francis was married to Mary, Queen of Scots, and it was Mary’s uncles who held the real power and Catherine was regent in name only. Francis was crowned at Rheims as was customary but within eighteen months he too was dead after an ear infection led to an abscess in his brain. He was succeeded by his younger brother who became Charles IX.\nCatherine was not to let this opportunity slip through her fingers. The Guises held no particular power over Charles and Catherine took the reins of government on herself, finally able to exercise some power. During Charles’s minority and beyond, Catherine strove to reconcile the Catholics and Huguenots (French Protestants) and avoid civil war. Catherine was pragmatic on matters of religion and hoped to achieve an accord by extending toleration to Protestants while maintaining the support of the powerful Catholic factions. Despite her efforts, antagonism on both sides spiralled out of control and France was torn apart by thirty-six years of on and off civil war.\nThe nadir of Catherine’s period of power was the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre which began on 23 August 1572 and led to the murder of thousands of Huguenots. The Massacre followed the marriage of Catherine’s daughter Marguerite (known popularly as Margot) to Henri of Navarre, the Protestant king of Navarre. The marriage, of a prominent member of the Catholic ruling family, to Henri, a Prince of the Blood and a Calvinist, had been designed to unite the quarrelling factions and bring about it a lasting peace. It was not to be: another civil war followed.\nCharles IX died only two years after the massacre, reputedly driven almost mad with guilt. He was succeeded by his brother who styled himself Henri III. Although Henri was old enough to rule in his own right, Catherine retained a prominent position at court and Henri left her to deal with the business of ruling which did not interest him, preferring to devote himself to acts of conspicuous piety, such as flagellation.\nThough he married, like his brothers before him, he too failed to produce a male heir. The throne to which Catherine had held on so tightly was slipping from their grasp. When Catherine’s youngest son, the duc d’Alençon, the heir apparent, died before his thirtieth birthday, Henri was forced to name his brother-in-law Henri of Navarre as his successor.\nThe Guises, horrified at the prospect of a Protestant king, rallied their men and took control of Paris. Henri, under Catherine’s advice, fled the city for Blois to regroup. There, he summoned the duc de Guise. It was a trap and on his entrance to the king’s chambers, Guise was set upon by the guard. Catherine knew nothing of Henri’s plan and on discovering what had happened, knew that Henri’s days too were numbered.\nLess than a fortnight later, Catherine herself died at Blois. She did not live to see her favourite son murdered and Henri of Navarre’s eventual succession to the throne as Henri IV. He later divorced Margot and remarried and so none of his successors carried Catherine’s blood, nor that of her beloved Henri. It was Henri IV though who brought about the peace which Catherine had tried so hard to effect.\nThis entry was posted in Catherine de Medicis, Diane de Poitiers, Henri de Navarre, Infamous Women and tagged anniversary, Catherine de' Medici, Diane de Poitiers, France, henri de navarre, history, History of Europe, Loire, mistresses, postaweek2011 on January 5, 2011 by Gillian."

Mechanistically, these results are connected with a substantial inhibition Lenalidomide of HDAC activity, histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II, leading to transcriptional reactivation of focus on genes (i.e., IL-3) in any other case silenced with the AML1/ETO fusion proteins. Eventually, these pharmacological results led to significant antileukemic activity mediated by incomplete cell differentiation and caspase-dependent apoptosis . VPA was lately proven to enhance proliferation and self-renewal of regular hematopoietic stem cells, increasing the chance that VPA could also support development of leukemic progenitor cells (LPC). Certainly, VPA taken care of a considerably higher percentage of Compact disc34(+) LPC and colony developing units in comparison to control civilizations in six AML examples, but selectively decreased leukemic cell amounts in another AML test with appearance of AML1/ETO. These data recommend a differential aftereffect of VPA on the tiny inhabitants of AML progenitor cells and the majority of aberrantly differentiated blasts in nearly all AML samples examined . The brand new hydroxamic acidity derivative, ITF2357, obstructed proliferation and induced apoptosis Lenalidomide in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 and major blast cells in focus of 0.1?M, whereas AML1/ETO-negative HL60, THP1 and NB4 cell lines were private and then 1?M ITF2357. In Kasumi-1 cells, ITF2357 induced AML1/ETO degradation through a caspase-dependent system and also established DNMT1 efflux from, and p300 influx to, the nucleus. Furthermore, ITF2357 induced regional H4 acetylation and discharge of DNMT1, HDAC1 and AML1/ETO, paralleled by recruitment of p300 towards the IL-3 gene promoter. ITF2357 treatment, nevertheless, did not stimulate re-expression of IL-3 gene. Appropriately, the methylation degree of IL-3 promoter, aswell as of other genes, was unmodified . As VPA and ITF2357 appear to particularly focus on AML1/ETO-driven leukemogenesis, integration of both course I-selective and pan-DACi in book therapeutic techniques for AML1/ETO-positive AML could be beneficial. Single-agent DACi in severe lymphoblastic leukemia The anti-leukemic activity of DACi in every has been analyzed in a small amount of preclinical studies; many of these examined DACi as an individual agent using individual ALL cell lines as versions. An early research compared the consequences from the cyclic tetrapeptide romidepsin (FK228) on individual leukemia/lymphoma cells and cell lines with regular hematopoietic cells . Romidepsin induced G1 arrest and apoptotic cell loss of life at nanomolar concentrations. Scientific samples from sufferers with ALL had been more delicate to romidepsin at medically achievable medication concentrations than either regular peripheral bloodstream or bone tissue marrow mononuclear cells or regular progenitor cells. Manifestation degrees of HDAC-1 and HDAC-3 proteins didn’t correlate using the level of sensitivity to romidepsin. The anti-leukemic activity and setting of action from the hydroxamic acidity derivative, LAQ824 was analyzed using four human being pre-B lymphoblastic cell lines as versions representing different cytogenetic subsets (Sup-B15 and TMD-5, both t(9;22) positive, SEM, t(4;11) positive, and NALM-6 cells). LAQ824 considerably inhibited the proliferation of leukemic lymphoblastic cell lines; this is due to improved apoptosis followed by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) aswell as by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and disruption from the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, LAQ824-induced apoptosis was ZC3H13 partly impartial of caspase activation . Panobinostat (LBH589), a broad-spectrum DACi carefully linked to the hydroxamate LAQ824 but with an increase of beneficial pharmacologic properties, potently induced cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and histone (H3K9 and H4K8) hyperacetylation in two human being cell line types of Philadelphia chromosome-negative severe lymphoblastic leukemia.\nThis entry was posted in mGlu3 Receptors and tagged Lenalidomide, ZC3H13 on October 27, 2018 by techbizstrategy."

    "text": "Use the law and your employer's complaint procedures to protect yourself from on-the-job harassment.\nIf the harasser ignores your oral requests to stop, or if you are uncomfortable talking to the harasser face to face, write a succinct letter demanding an end to the behavior. Be sure to keep a copy.\nIf you are concerned for your personal safety or are afraid that the harasser might become more hostile when confronted, complain to a supervisor instead.\nAlthough it is often difficult to make a complaint at work, and you may prefer to skip this step, don't. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that employees who fail to use their employer's internal complaint procedure to make the company aware of sexual harassment, and to give the company a chance to stop it, cannot later hold the company liable in a lawsuit. This means that you are quite likely to lose in court, should it come to that, if you don't complain within the company first.\nEven if your company doesn't have a formal complaint procedure, you can put the company on notice of the harassment. You can do this by making a complaint to the human resources department, telling your supervisor (or his or her supervisor) about the problem, or informing a company executive.\nIt is very important to document what is happening to you, and what you are doing to try to stop it, should you ever have to prove your case to a company investigator, a government agency, or a jury.\nStart by collecting as much detailed evidence as possible about the harassment. Be sure to save any offensive letters, photographs, cards, or notes you receive. If you were made to feel uncomfortable because of jokes, pin-ups, or cartoons posted at work, confiscate them -- or at least make copies. An anonymous, obnoxious photo or joke posted on a bulletin board is not anyone else's personal property, so you are free to take it down and keep it as evidence. If that's not possible, photograph the workplace walls. Note the dates the offensive material was posted -- and whether there were hostile reactions when you took it down or asked another person to do so.\nAlso, keep a detailed journal about incidents of harassment. Include the names of everyone involved, what happened, and where and when it took place. If anyone else saw or heard the harassment, note that as well. Be as specific as possible about what was said and done -- and how it affected you, your health, or your job performance. Keep your journal and notes at home or in a secure location outside of the workplace.\nIf your employer has conducted periodic written evaluations of your work, make sure you have copies. In fact, you may want to ask for a copy of your entire personnel file before complaining about a harassing coworker. Your records can be particularly persuasive evidence if your employer retaliates against you for complaining -- which is also illegal. For example, you'll want a copy of your records if you've had positive performance evaluations until you complain, and then your employer tries to transfer, demote, or fire you or claims your job performance is poor.\nIf complaining to your employer doesn’t help, the next step is to go to either the federal agency that enforces Title VII -- the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- or to your state fair employment office. If all investigation and settlement attempts fail to produce satisfactory results, you can file a civil lawsuit for damages under either Title VII or your state fair employment practices statute.\nYou must file a complaint with the EEOC before filing a federal lawsuit. Even if you intend right from the beginning to file a lawsuit, you sometimes must first file a claim with a government agency. For example, an employee pursuing a claim under federal law must first file a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and a similar complaint procedure is required under some state laws.\nThe EEOC or state agency may decide to prosecute your case on your behalf, but that happens rarely. More commonly, at some point, the agency will issue you a document referred to as a \"right-to-sue\" letter that allows you to take your case to court with your own lawyer.\nNote, however, that there are time limits for filing claims with government agencies and for filing a lawsuit, so be sure not to miss them."

I know that some places had some snow and some places had quite a lot of snow – and then there were the places that had loads of snow. The wind was just bitterly cold in most places but if you where in one of those places with more snow than we had here, the wind did its best and took the snow and piled it in varying sized heaps for you. I suppose you should have left a note out, telling it where you wanted the snow drifted to.\nPersonally, well, let me put it this way. You know how, over this last year or so, everyone has become rather grumpy with climate warming overload? And you know how they picked on the Met Office for trying to push the temperatures up? I suppose there is a possibility that someone in the purchasing department there, didn’t realise that there are a hundred and forty four packs in a carton and that snow comes freeze dried (just add water) and then ordered a thousand cartons when they only meant to order a thousand packs.\nBut it would be easy to think that it wasn’t an accident, wouldn’t it?"

The current study used virtual reality to investigate the biological specificity of interference effects of action observation in autism spectrum conditions (ASC).\nMethod High-functioning adults with ASC and age- and IQ-matched healthy controls performed horizontal sinusoidal arm movements whilst observing arm movements conducted by a virtual reality agent with either human or robot form, which moved with either biological motion or at a constant velocity. In another condition, participants made the same arm movements while observing a real human. Observed arm movements were either congruent or incongruent with executed arm movements. An interference effect was calculated as the average variance in the incongruent action dimension during observation of incongruent compared with congruent movements.\nResults Control participants exhibited an interference effect when observing real human and virtual human agent incongruent movements but not when observing virtual robot agent movements. Individuals with ASC differed from controls in that they showed no interference effects for real human, virtual human or virtual robot movements.\nConclusions The current study demonstrates atypical interference effects in ASC."

The 1970's And Women's Skateboarding.\nWe have been waiting for this book to arrive! Browsing through the just released \"Skateboarding is Not a Fashion\" is like a time capsule of skateboarding and what we wore from the 1950's to 1984.

    "text": "What Is iCloud? And How Do I Use It?\nWhat Is iCloud? How Do I Use It?\nThe Cloud. We hear it all the time these days. But what exactly is the cloud and how does it relate to iCloud? At its most basic level, the cloud is the Internet, or more accurately, a piece of the Internet. The underlying metaphor is that the Internet is the sky and that the sky is made up of all of these different clouds, each one of which can provide a different service. The Gmail cloud, for instance, delivers us our mail. The Dropbox cloud stores our files. So where does the iCloud fall into this?\nThese services include iCloud Drive, which is similar to Dropbox and Google Drive, iCloud Photo Library, which is an offshoot of Photo Stream, iTunes Match and even Apple Music. iCloud also provides us with a way to back up our iPad in case we need to restore it at a future point, and while we can download the iWork suite to our iPad from the App Store, we can also run Pages, Numbers, and Keynote on our laptop or desktop PCs through icloud.com.\nSo what is iCloud? It is the name of Apple's cloud-based or Internet-based services, of which there are plenty.\nWhat Can I Get From iCloud? How Can I Use It?\niCloud Backup and Restore. Let's start with the most basic use for the service that everyone should be using. Apple provides 5 GB of free iCloud storage for Apple ID account, which is the account you use to login to the App Store and buy apps. This storage can be used for many purposes including storing photos, but perhaps its best use is for backing up your iPad.\nBy default, every time you plug your iPad into a wall outlet or a computer to charge it, the iPad will attempt to back itself up to iCloud. You can also manually initiate a backup by opening the Settings app and navigating to iCloud > Backup > Back Up Now. You can restore from a backup by following the procedure to reset your iPad to factory default and then choosing to restore from the backup during the setup process of the iPad.\nIf you upgrade to a new iPad, you can also choose to restore from a backup, which makes the upgrade process seamless.\nFind My Device. Another important feature of iCloud is the Find My iPhone/iPad/MacBook service. Not only can you use this feature to track down the whereabouts of your iPad or iPhone, but you can also use it to lock down the iPad if it is lost or even remotely reset it to factory default, which erases all data on the iPad. While it can sound creepy to have your iPad tracked wherever it travels, it also combines with putting a passcode lock on your iPad to make it quite secure.\niCloud Drive. Apple's cloud storage solution isn't quite as smooth as Dropbox, but it ties in well with the iPad, iPhone, and Macs. You can also access iCloud Drive from Windows, so you aren't locked into Apple's ecosystem. So what is iCloud Drive? It is a service that allows apps to store documents on the Internet, which allows you to access those files from multiple devices. In this way, you can create a Numbers spreadsheet on your iPad, access it from your iPhone, pull it up on your Mac to make edits and even use your Windows-based PC to modify it by signing into iCloud.com.\niCloud Photo Library, Shared Photo Albums, and My Photo Stream. Apple has been hard at work delivering a cloud-based photo solution for a few years now and they've ended with a bit of a mess.\nMy Photo Stream is a service that uploads every picture taken to the cloud and downloads it onto every other device signed up for My Photo Stream. This can make for awkward situations, especially if you don't want every photo uploaded to the Internet. It also means if you take a picture of a product in a store so you can remember the brand name or model number, that picture will find its way onto every other device. Still, the feature can be a life-saver for those who want the photos taken on their iPhone to transfer to their iPad without doing any work. Unfortunately, My Photo Stream photos disappear after a while, holding a maximum of 1000 photos at a time.\niCloud Photo Library is the new version of Photo Stream. The big difference is that it actually uploads the photos to iCloud permanently, so you don't have to worry about the maximum number of photos. You also have the ability to download the entire image on your device or an optimized version that doesn't take up as much storage space. Unfortunately, iCloud Photo Library isn't part of iCloud Drive.\nApple, in their infinite *cough* wisdom, decided to keep the photos separate and, while they advertise the photos are easily accessible on your Mac or Windows-based PC, the actual usability is poor. However, as a service, iCloud Photo Library is still very useful even if Apple hasn't quite nailed the idea of cloud-based photos.\nContacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, etc. Many of the basic apps that come with the iPad can utilize iCloud to sync between devices. So if you wanted to access notes from your iPad and your iPhone, you can simply turn on Notes in the iCloud section of your iPad's settings. Similarly, if you turn on Reminders, you can use Siri to set a reminder on your iPhone and the reminder will also appear on your iPad.\niTunes Match and Apple Music. Apple Music is Apple's answer to Spotify, a subscription-based all-you-can-listen service that allows you to pay $9.99 a month to stream an incredibly large selection of music. This is a great way to save on buying songs all the time. Apple Music songs can even be downloaded, so you can listen if you aren't connected to the Internet, and placed into your playlists.\niTunes Match is a rather cool service that doesn't get much press these days. It is a $24.99 a year service that allows you to stream your music library from the cloud, which means you don't need to put a copy of the song on your iPad to listen to it. How is it different from Apple Music? Well, first, you will need to actually own the song to use it with iTunes Match. However, iTunes Match will work with any song, even those that are unavailable for streaming through Apple Music. iTunes Match will also stream the best version of the song, so if the song has been tweaked to a higher audio resolution, you'll hear the better version. And at roughly $2 a month, it's a lot cheaper."

    "text": "When finding your next work assignment, there is more to consider than just salary. Along with examining your fit with company culture, you want to ask about your benefits package. Remember to learn more about these four benefits when deciding which assignment to take.\nDo you qualify for health insurance? Because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many staffing agencies offer their permanent and temporary employees the qualifying minimum essential coverage to comply with ACA regulations. Being offered health insurance can reduce your costs for a policy that may otherwise be unaffordable. Since you are required by law to have health insurance, and because health insurance premiums continue rising, you most likely want to get a policy through your employer. Due to increased competition for top candidates, you may be able to negotiate lower premiums or increased coverage to reduce your overall costs.\nWill you receive paid time off? For instance, ask how many vacation days, sick days, and personal days you are allowed. Also, determine how many days off you may have for maternity/paternity leave, adoption, bereavement, or other life-changing events. Additionally, find out when you are first able to take paid time off in case an unforeseen event happens.\nCan you work flexible hours? Deciding when you start and end your workday leaves room to take care of personal needs. Whether you have family responsibilities, doctor appointments, errands to run, or other commitments, you can plan your work schedule accordingly. Having a flexible schedule promotes a healthy work-life balance.\nAre you eligible for a client company’s retirement plan? Under the Internal Revenue Code, you may be able to participate in a client company’s retirement plan if you were hired because of an agreement between the staffing agency and client company sponsoring the retirement plan; you work under the primary direction and control of the client company sponsoring the plan; and you work on a substantially full-time basis for at least one year, typically 1,000 hours. Unless the client company’s retirement plan specifically excludes temporary employees in its eligibility requirements, you should be able to participate.\nWith our candidate-first approach, we commit ourselves to finance and accounting professionals’ careers.

He hit .309 with 23 home runs for Keokuk in 1958; .285 with 28 homers for Winston-Salem and Tulsa in 1959; .310 with 22 homers for Tulsa in 1960; and .301 with 18 homers for Charleston in 1961.\nHe was batting .323 and leading the International League in home runs (eight) and RBI (28) when he was promoted to the Cardinals on May 26, 1962.\nThe Cardinals were seeking a right-handed batter to replace injured outfielder Minnie Minoso. Because of a weak throwing arm after he hurt his shoulder as an American Legion pitcher, Whitfield only could play first base. Unlike Minoso, he batted left-handed.\nAccording to The Sporting News, it was Cardinals business manager Art Routzong who convinced general manager Bing Devine and manager Johnny Keane to promote Whitfield.\nIn his first five pinch-hit appearances for the Cardinals, Whitfield produced three hits and a walk.\nWhitfield finished the 1962 season with a .266 batting average, eight home runs and 34 RBI in 158 at-bats for the Cardinals. He hit .333 as a pinch-hitter and .412 with two outs and runners in scoring position. He was especially effective versus the Phillies, batting .313 with 13 RBI in 12 games.\n“Fred did an exceptionally good job, especially as a pinch-hitter and part-time player, jobs usually handled by older, experienced men,” Devine said.\nHowever, Whitfield became expendable because White, who batted left-handed, was entrenched at first base, and the Cardinals needed pitching.\nOn Dec. 15, 1962, the Cardinals dealt Whitfield to the Indians for pitcher Ron Taylor and infielder Jack Kubiszyn.\nWhitfield hit 20 or more home runs three times for the Indians (21 in 1963, 26 in 1965 and 27 in 1966). In a nine-year major-league career (1962-70), he played for the Cardinals, Indians, Reds and Expos, batting .253 with 108 home runs."

    "text": "Pitt is considering several options to deal with a lack of steady enrollment at Pitt-Titusville, including shuttering the branch campus, mainly due to a lack of steady enrollment, according to a report released last Thursday.\nUniversity officials released an analysis listing more problems than possible solutions for Pitt’s Titusville campus, including a fiscal year deficit of $1.7 million in 2016. As stated in the report, the biggest threat to the campus’s success is the spotty enrollment, combined with competition from other higher education providers in the region.\nAdministrators made a push in 2013 to innovate the courses provided at the campus by offering a petroleum technology course, as well as classes in computer technology, criminal justice, psychology, biological sciences and history. The addition of the degree in petroleum technology, which Titusville offered as an associate’s degree jointly with the Pitt-Bradford campus, made reference to the town’s history with the oil industry.\nEnrollment numbers for these courses were lower than expected, however, and the petroleum technology course, though successful at Pitt’s Bradford campus, was terminated after just two years.\nThe report mentions that this decline fits into a larger trend occurring throughout Western Pennsylvania. At UPT alone, enrollment has declined 40 percent from the fall semester of 2009 to fall 2016, with its peak in 2007.\nThis decline goes beyond UPT. The analysis cites that enrollment across the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education has decreased by more than 12 percent between the fall semester of 2010 and fall 2016.\nRepublican Kathy Rapp, who represents the district that includes Titusville in the state House of Representatives, noted that the campus plays a central role in the area’s economic well-being.\n“I would be very concerned if Pitt decided to close the campus,” she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Monday.\nStructural changes related to decreases in student population have primarily affected schools in northwestern Pennsylvania, hitting hard at institutions of higher education like Clarion and Edinboro Universities. It’s also worth noting that flagship public universities have experienced an increase in enrollment in recent years, signifying a shift rather than disappearance of students in the area.\nConcerns about the Titusville region have played a role in the University’s deliberations about a potential course of action regarding the branch campus, according to Pitt vice provost for special projects Lawrence Feick.\n“We focused on three criteria: serving the education and training needs of Titusville and the region, the mission of the University of Pittsburgh and financial sustainability,” Feick said in a press release.\nOfficials have come up with five potential solutions to the school’s declining success — continue with the status quo, close the campus down entirely and three variations of revised ownership for the campus that would reduce University involvement with the campus.\nOf the final three options, the first considers running the campus as commuter-only, while operations remain under control of Pitt. The second of these would still have Pitt own and operate the campus, but with outside academic providers offering additional programs. The last option would be a third party ownership of the campus, with Pitt as one of its tenants. In this arrangement, Pitt would still support academic programs on the campus along with several other tenants.\nIn its official report on the status of the branch campus, the University suggested that an alternative ownership scheme in Titusville could be better suited to the needs of the region.\n“A separate ownership entity could, for example, sharpen the focus on local needs and be more aggressive, and nimble, in pursuing opportunities,” the report stated.\nThe University will be accepting public comments up until June 15 for consideration in the report’s revision and presentation to the Board of Trustees. This report will be finalized in the fall, followed by implementation over the next several years.\nRepresentatives from Pitt will be at the UPT campus June 9 from 9 to 10 a.m. at Henne Auditorium to receive comment and input."

Creamy vanilla, oak and some tropical fruits.\nWonderful first fill ex-Bourbon barrel notes at first in the taste! Burned oak and vanilla, just like it is supposed to be! The majority of flavours might die out a bit fast in the finish, but you are still left with some great flavours in the end for quite a while!\nThis must have been some good casks! A lot of flavour for such young whisky! Not very often you come across these low age statement whiskies with so much flavour, and that is fantastic! Age is NOT everything – cask is KING! I will give this 84/100 (20/22/21//21).\na very useful information, Thanks!"

I rekin that I could burn it to some DVD's & mail them to interested parties in a few weeks (next cupla weeks are slammed for me so can't any sooner).\nSome people do this... They want to \"disappear\" and take away any evidence having contributed to the forum. I really hate when people do this! They are effectively sabotaging forum�s database! As forum admin, I try to ban people as soon as I notice this, but sometime they are tough catch before damage is done . One way to combat this, is to take away ability to edit posts after a day or two. How often do we have a LEGITIMATE reason to edit days old post?\nTom, what was in this thread? I see people raving about how great IT is, but what IT?\nHe had posted links to a bunch of maintenance stuff that was really good to have on hand (including TSBs).\nI'll have to go back through it all to see what all it included.\nI reckin I could make an extra donation to the site for a copy of that DVD young fella.\nNo hurry (oh no, can't believe I said that to the world's worseted procrastinator!!!!).\nMark, as usual, you come through! This is great.\nThat linky couldn't be found.\nThat's no way to put yerself on the top-o-da list dude.\nI've actually gone through the files & organized them a little better. It works out to about 1.4GB & includes my entire private collection in addition to what Mark posted.\nI'll try to pick up some DVDs & mailers tomorrow & start burning them on Friday.\nIt took 20 min for the first copy. Rekin I'll be letting it run in the background for the next few weeks.\nPK, yer copy is ready.\nTom, I responded on your other post.\nBut there is REALLY no hurry.\nWhat is the biggest tire that will fit?\nThe biggest day of the year!\nAm I the biggest fool ever ???"

    "text": "As promised I’m continuing to document Lola’s chiropractic journey. She is now on her third week of treatment and we are seeing some positive things. We have noticed a small change in her motion level. Especially in regards to jumping up and down. In addition to the positive behavior changes, Lola has also experienced some detox symptoms such as lethargy and diarrhea. These did not last long or affect her significantly.\nWe continue to have a great experience with our Living Well Chiropractic friends. They are great with kids, using phrases like “time for popcorn back” or “I’m going to make you into a pretzel, do you like your pretzels with cheese or salt?” Super cute and super relaxed for kiddos. Our visits are quick and Lola enjoys her time there. Charlotte tags along for appointments and has recently decided to be a chiropractor when she grows up, she gave me a practice adjustment yesterday. Adorable.\nI will keep the updates coming! We are hopeful and excited.\nAfter one year of planning, making reservations and saving money our family made a grand visit to Disney World. We knew this would come with some challenges so we did our best to plan ahead, especially where Lola’s needs were concerned. She really had a great week and we were impressed with how the Cast Members (Disney employees) responded to her.\nWe were given a Disability Access Card, which I will refer to as the DAS card. This is a new system for kids and adults who aren’t able to wait in lines without great distress. Lola’s blindness and sensory issues make waiting in line very difficult, meltdowns etc. Trust me, we did the 40 minute wait for Buzz Lightyear without the DAS and it was a quasi-disaster.\nThe DAS card is basically waiting in line while out of line. To acquire the card you simply stop by the customer service area at the front of the park, explain the disability and why it makes lines difficult. We were asked very little questions and it was a very smooth process. They took Lola’s picture and printed out a little card with her name and photo on the front.\nTo use the card you simply hand it to the cast member at the front of each ride and they write a return time on the card. The return time is the current wait time minus 10 minutes. So if the Mine Train wait was 70 minutes our return would be an hour later. We were able to ride other rides with short wait times, eat a meal, take in the Christmas decor or rest a little. We also utilized fast pass so DAS wasn’t necessary with all rides. The cast members were always friendly and although the pass was only for 6 people they had no problem allowing more family members to ride with Lola. We were also allowed to sit in the very front for events like the Frozen Sing Along.\nIn addition to finding success with the DAS card we also found the characters and cast members quick to pick up on Lola’s extra needs and respond appropriately. For example, the characters recognized Lola’s need to get super close and to touch their costumes. They would take her hand and put it on their nose (Mickey) or bend down toward her face. We typically didn’t mention her eyes, but it was clear they realized that her experience needed to be slightly different.\nLola was also chosen to take part in a few shows. We were hesitant at first but once we informed the cast members they were sure to guide her and give her extra cues, no problem. Lola even played the part of the Beast, dancing with Belle as the story was told.\nWe had a great week at Disney, celebrating our family and spending time with extended family. We hope to return again in a few years to relive all the fun and excitement. Despite the changes to the disability system I still give Disney a thumbs up in this department.\nSo glad you guys had a great time - how wonderful too for Lola to have that experience!\nLet’s be honest. For most of us, the last week has been focused on how much we can get and how little we can get it for. Now, let’s be fair. As some of you may know, today is Fair Tuesday as in shop Fair Trade today. There is tons of stuff for women, but this post is focused on the stuff for guys, who are always harder to shop for.\nThese items focus on being fairly traded, ethically sourced, and life impacting. Here are 5 on Calvin’s list.\nThe Piko is a durable lightweight bag that delivers when you need it the most. With separate laptop access and the front instant pocket, the Piko is ideal for a person that is on the move from place to place. #GiveTuesday Sale!

The Wonderbag is a non-electric, heat-retention cooker that allows food that has been brought to a boil, to continue cooking after it has been removed from the fuel source. All our recipes have recommended timings and simple steps to guide the Wonderbag cooking process.

Travel ready and features multiple card slots and compartments for a passport, credit cards, ID and cash, along with frequent flyer cards and flight tickets.\nMade in Ethiopia, the Adibo combines style with durable, lasting comfort. Each shoe is created with the goal of contributing to the development of a thriving middle class in Africa. Curated by Invisible Children in partnership with Oliberte: This is Africa. Currently on sale for $40. Free shipping for $100 orders.\n– Subtle variations add to the uniqueness of each product.\nWe have made an effort to simplify our Christmas over the past few years; three gifts, focus on Jesus, and more time at home. Advent readings are a great addition, keeping our focus steady as we move through a world that constantly pulls our attention elsewhere. I was excited to find a free Advent Reading plan that corresponds with a book that many of us already have, the Jesus Storybook Bible. (use code HOLIDAY30 to get 30% off) Oh how I love this book. If you don’t have it, do yourself a favor and put it in your child’s stocking. It’s inexpensive and illustrates how the entire Bible points toward Jesus, our savior. It is captivating and beautifully written and illustrated. Our children are all young (3-7 years old) but definitely at varying developmental ages and interests, I’ve found that this book keeps them all equally engaged.\nHere is the full link, including a section for notes.\nWhat are you planning for advent this year? I would love to hear your ideas and traditions.\nGood points all around. Truly apcetpiared.\nI wrote about kindness yesterday. Which is helpful because posts like this need to come from a heart FULL of kindness and a desire to educate rather than rant.\nThe Holiday season ushers in many opportunities to help families and individuals in need. It’s a beautiful thing as many families are struggling rather than celebrating. However, organizations that aim to help these families, individuals and kids have chosen to use the word adoption in their campaigns. The word adoption has been made synonymous with the word help, sponsor and support. While this seems harmless to the general population, we’ve somehow forgotten that the general population contains thousands upon thousands of adoptees.\nI realize that there is no way to make everyone happy. And many who read this will think, “oh great, another PC term I have to remember.” But this is more than not being politically correct. It’s downright INCORRECT. Adoption doesn’t mean helping. Adoption is permanent. Adoption is creating a family. Adoption is hard. Adoption can be painful. Adoption is beautiful.\nIf you’re wondering how common the issue is, here are just a few organizations using this wording.\nI respect my children who entered our family via adoption. I respect their right to grieve, to ask questions, to be confused. I will walk with them through every step of every mess that comes our way. I will be their voice when they come home and ask if the 3-year old girl their class is “adopting” will live in their classroom. True story.\nThat is what happens when adoption is used incorrectly. A child who understands that adoption is forever is now being told that adoption can mean other things as well, like buying underwear for a child in need. Additionally, those kiddos we are sponsoring have PARENTS. Parents who love them enough to seek out assistance. Adoption does not pertain to these families.\nChurches, organizations, schools and Friends: Please consider replacing the word Adoption in your Christmas campaigns. There are wonderful words such as help, sponsor, support and bless that will accurately express the program. Take a chance, rebrand, the results will be respectful and wonderful."

    "text": "After 10 months of research and development, the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer’s manufacturing process is that 103 engineers participated in the 1010 mile hair test, and assembled the Dyson ninth generation digital motor, Air Amplifier airflow multiplication technology, intelligent temperature control and other technologies.\nFrom the appearance, the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer completely breaks through the appearance of the traditional hair dryer. Its head has a cylindrical design and is unique in the market. For such a look, I believe many people will fall in love with it at first sight.\nIn addition to the appearance, the Dyson hair dryer is also very detailed, with a three-speed wind speed button on the left side of the cylinder and a four-speed temperature key on the right side. The switch and the cold air button are placed at the handle. The overall operation is very simple and easy to use. The bottom of the handle is a filter. It is convenient to open and close. The filter is convenient for people to clean and clean regularly.\nI believe that women with thick hair have had such an experience. When using a normal hair dryer, the hair is still not dried, and the hands are already sore. This is because the motors of ordinary hair dryers are all arranged behind the blower of the hair dryer, which has the feeling of being top-heavy and uneven in weight distribution, and it is easy to increase the pressure on the hands during using it. Dyson’s innovative hair dryer design – its motor is designed in the handle, reducing the weight of the hair dryer head, making the overall weight distribution more uniform, and more lightweight and balanced use. Even if you take it for a long time, your arm won’t feel sore.\nWhen we use the hair dryer everyday, the most troublesome thing is the noise. When using the hair dryer, we can’t talk to others at all. Dyson took people’s needs into consideration during the design and development. Dyson increased the number of blades in the internal motor of the hair dryer from 11 to 13. The modulated motor made a sharp sound frequency in the human ear. Beyond the range, a more enjoyable blowing experience.\nComprehensive performance and appearance, Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is a product with high value, strong sense of technology and good performance. Use this hair dryer to dry your hair and instantly improve your sense of well-being. In addition, when you don’t use it, it is also very eye-catching at home. For such a high-value product that can improve the quality of life, it is still worth buying."

    "text": "Slots games can be loads of fun and there is often a choice of amounts to gamble. This will not only vary between sites and games but also within each game you often get a choice.\nIn slots there is often a selection of winning lines. You have to pick which winning line you would like to bet on. The more winning lines you pay for, the greater the odds of you actually getting a win. You may also find that if you want to have a chance of winning the jackpot, you will need to bet on all of the lines. This can add up to a lot of money.\nIn order to decide you need to consider several factors. The most important thing to think about to start with is the cost of the games. Calculate how much money you can afford to gamble and think about how many games you will be able to play with that money. It may be that you will be able to afford a lot of games, but you may have a tight budget and just be able to afford a few. Consider whether you are happy to pay out a lot of money per game and only pay for a few games and have a chance of winning the big jackpot or whether you would prefer your money to last longer, so you pay less per game but can only win small prizes.\nThe decision can be quite difficult. You have to weigh up whether you would get more pleasure from playing for longer or by giving yourself a chance of winning the jackpot but not playing for long. You may be prepared to take a lot of risk or rather not take so much and this will be a big influence in your decision as well.\nHow much you can afford to spend is a huge factor. It is surprising how many people do not think about this before they start playing. It is really important to make sure that you have enough money to pay for all of the things that you need so that you know that when you pay slots, you can afford to lose the money. Do not go in with the attitude that you will win money as the odds will be against you. It is far better to assume that you will lose and see any winnings as a bonus. If you do this, then you will not be so tempted to overspend. Consider that what you are paying out is for the fun of playing, it is not a way to make money. Casinos will always set up games so that they have a bigger chance of winning and therefore you are not likely to win.\nHow Are Gambling Sites Regulated In The UK?\nWhat Makes a Responsible Bingo Site?"

    "text": "TORONTO, Dec. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wayland Group (CSE:WAYL) (75M.F) (MRRCF) (“Wayland” or the “Company”), a global, vertically integrated cultivator and processor of cannabis, today announced that its Board of Directors has initiated a process to explore a broad range of strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to assessing the potential spin-out and/or European listing of its international assets (the “International Assets”) in an effort to unlock the value of the Company’s vast international asset portfolio (a “Spinout Transaction”), as well as its underlying domestic Canadian assets. Any Spinout Transaction of the International Assets could include the Company’s European, Latin American, and Asia-Pacific operations.\nThe Company strongly believes in its current strategy; however, it does not believe its current share price accurately reflects the global portfolio Wayland has, and continues to create.\n“We have demonstrated our capability in predicting future markets and working systematically to put supply chain in place, with some of the lowest transaction costs for international acquisitions in addition to organic growth and partnerships. Our exponential growth model has tremendous potential, as it is built on the solid foundation we have laid from five years of organizational learning as a licensed producer in Canada. This has allowed us to become one of five companies with EU-GMP certification on top of having all the requisite cultivation and processing licenses in Canada. It is time for us to capitalize on the largest future cannabis market in the world and focus our efforts in the wellness and medical markets to accomplish our vision of enhancing life through cannabis,” stated Ben Ward, CEO of Wayland.\nCanaccord Genuity Corp. has been retained to serve as the Company’s financial advisor related to the strategic review process.\nThere can be no assurance the strategic review will result in the completion of any transaction or any other alternative. The Company has not set a timetable for completion of the review process, and it does not intend to comment further unless a specific transaction or alternative is approved by the Board of Directors, the review process is concluded, or it is otherwise determined that other disclosure is appropriate.\nWayland has several active initiatives in Germany that give the Company a distinct advantage in the German and European markets. The Company is the only organization in the world that has a facility ready for domestic cannabis cultivation. Located in Ebersbach, just outside of Dresden, the proposed facility gives Wayland 820,000 square feet of clean-room cultivation, processing, and extraction capabilities. It is currently being utilized to process industrial hemp from the Company’s adjacent 164-hectare hemp operation where the Company recently completed their first harvest yielding over 120,000 kg of dry hemp flowers. Once processed, the CBD distillate will be used for the Company’s recently launched nutraceutical business, MariPlant GmbH. Finally, the Company expects to receive their second EU-GMP certification for the Ebersbach facility in a matter of weeks, further strengthening Wayland’s medical production and distribution capabilities.\nWayland’s second European cultivation site is located in Regensdorf, Switzerland, a suburb of Zurich. The 60,000 square foot facility’s current production profile is approximately 2,000 kg of CBD flower per year. Wayland plans to upgrade this facility to bring it in line with the Company’s production standards from existing GACP standards and increase capacity to 14,000 kg per year with the goal of developing their own CBD products for sale throughout Switzerland and the rest of the European Union. Wayland will locate its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) manufacturing site for its global operations in Switzerland, taking advantage of existing phyto pharmaceutical talent in country.\nWayland has a definitive joint venture agreement with CBD Italian Factory S.S., a company of Group San Martino for the production of high quality cannabis products in Italy. The Company expects that the joint venture will marry the best of both entities with world-leading technology by Rockwell Automation paired with existing infrastructure in Piedmont, Italy, which includes agricultural expertise and biogas electricity. This will allow the sustainable production of quality CBD and THC products from a naturally derived fuel source. CBD Italian Factory S.S. and San Martino Group will bring mass-scale agricultural skills to the joint venture with a focus on local sustainable practices and expertise in Biomass Energy production. The Company holds 50.1 % of the joint venture while 49.9% is held by CBD Italian Factory, with Massimiliano Umberto Signorini assuming the role of CEO for the new company.\nIn July of 2018, Wayland’s application to Malta Enterprise to set up a business in Malta to manufacture finished dose medical cannabis was approved. Malta will offer the Company a unique advantage as Wayland will have the ability to import, extract, manufacture finished dose products, and distribute cannabis for medical purposes within Malta and the entire European Union. Malta Enterprise allows the Company to develop a wide variety of pharmaceutical products and export them across the European Union, and as Malta is a member of the EU, certain VAT tax are inapplicable to Malta Enterprise.\nThe Company has entered into an agreement to acquire a 51% stake in U.K. based Theros Pharma Ltd. (“Theros”), an early stage company that has successfully imported cannabis to the U.K. for patients with a prescription for medical cannabis. The company expects to be able to import cannabis to patients in the UK as early as March 2019.\nWayland has entered into an agreement to purchase 819 hectares of existing developed agriculture land in San Juan Province in Argentina, which is the ideal micro climate for cultivation. The properly has existing mass scale irrigation, using runoff from the Andes Mountains, and produces 1,000,000 kg of wine juice, and 400,000 kg of olives per year. Existing on site agronomists and farmers will take their knowledge of horticulture and apply it to Wayland’s existing world class system of cannabis cultivation. Outdoor cultivation will take place in existing alfalfa fields, to supply Wayland with low cost inputs. Initial extraction will take place in Argentina.\nThe Company has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Colma Pharmaceutical SAS (“Colma”), a licensed producer of THC cannabis in Colombia, holding four licenses for cultivation and processing on a leased premise in Ibaque, Colombia. Wayland plans to cultivate THC cannabis outdoor and year-round with an infrastructure investment including 415,000 square feet of processing and clone and vegetation greenhouse facilities to support outdoor cannabis flower production of 125 hectares.\nWayland has entered into an agreement to acquire 50.1% of Tropicann Pty Ltd. (“Tropicann”), a privately owned Australian company located in Darwin, Northern Territory. It plans to build an outdoor grow facility to take advantage of the ideal cannabis cultivation climate with minimal environmental impact. The Company believes it can leverage a major port in Darwin that will provide access to major APAC markets.\nThe Company’s flagship facility is located in Langton, Ontario with cultivation, extraction, formulation, and distribution capabilities. The facility is a purpose-built cannabis production facility with an emphasis on automation and energy efficiencies. The Company partnered with Rockwell Automation to develop a fully automated system including the development of AI Data Grow, the Company’s artificially intelligent master grower. This allows Wayland to drastically reduce its cultivation labour needs by approximately 90% of the industry average while also mitigating risks associated with infecting crops. The facility will be completed in two phases, the first of which is approximately 225,000 square feet in size with 90,000 square feet of production and office space and approximately 135,000 square feet of grow space which will yield the Company approximately 65,000 kg of dried cannabis flower per year. Phase two will bring an additional 719,000 square feet of grow space online taking production capacity much greater than 100,000 kg per year.\nWayland’s Langton campus has been certified by the European Medicines Agency after receiving the certification of EU-Good Manufacturing Practices (“EU-GMP”). EU-GMP certification allowed Wayland to sign the largest ever medical cannabis export deal with Cannamedical of Germany, agreeing to provide the medical cannabis distributor with a minimum of 9,000 kg of product over a three-year period. Wayland is one of only five cannabis companies in the world to receive the EU-GMP designation which is another advantage the Company believes it has in the global medical cannabis arena as demonstrated by this large purchase order.\nManitoba: Supply agreement with the Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries Corporation (“MBLL”) to make available for purchase by MBLL at least 550kg of various cannabis products during the first twelve months of the agreement.\nAlberta: Supply Agreement with the Alberta Gaming, Liquor & Cannabis Commission (“AGLC”) to allocate up to 3,375kg of cannabis product for the Alberta market within the first six months.\nBritish Columbia: Through a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”), Wayland is a preferred licensed producer to the BC Liquor Distribution Branch (“BCLDB”) to initially supply approximately 3,622kg of non-medical cannabis to BCLDB over the first 12 months following legalization.\nOntario: Selected by The Ontario Cannabis Store (“OCS”) to supply a variety of safe, high quality cannabis products through its online store since launching October 17, 2018.\nThe Company has taken a purposeful and consumer-centric approach to each of its brands/offerings, each validated and optimized with local consumer research. Strains within each portfolio will match brand positioning and satisfy target consumer needs and benefits.\nSolara C: Designed for the modern, active consumer who is looking to find solutions to help them live healthier/better without using stronger pharmaceutical alternatives.

    "text": "My phone went off early this morning at 6.30 and I leapt out of bed in a panic thinking immediately of the worst, that something had happened to my mother.\nOnly once I reached the phone, answered it and it had stopped ringing did I realise I had set the alarm the night before and my mother was most likely okay, but even then I could not return to sleep.\nI am living in a strange time, this hovering on the edge between life and death, my mother’s life and death, and wondering when it might happen. My husband is away and I am holding the fort or so it seems, which adds to the surreal tensions that envelope me everyday.\nA few days ago I received a letter from an old friend, a woman whom I shall name Cate, who now lives in country Victoria. I did not recognise her name on the envelope at first because Cate now travels under the name of her third husband. But as I began to read her letter pennies began to drop into place.\nShe is sorry, Cate writes, to have lost contact with us, with my husband and me, but she had imagined at the time of her separation from her second husband that we were ‘on his side’.\nHow strange I thought reading this and remembering back to that time. I did not enjoy Cate’s second husband at all, and I was not so much sad as surprised when they separated.\nI have a soft spot for Cate. It was she who in a sense brought my husband and me together all those years ago.\nI once worked alongside Cate in the days when I was a newly graduated social worker. One Saturday evening Cate held a dinner party – dinner parties were fashionable in those days – and through a long and complicated series of manoeuvres, my husband and I wound up together at the dinner table.\nIn a sense we have not been apart since. Though do not imagine it has always been a honeymoon but a productive union nevertheless, and Cate believes she was responsible for beginning it, as indeed in some ways she was.\nI have not seen Cate now for some fifteen or maybe more years. We ran into her, shopping in Safeway, one Saturday afternoon. She seemed distant at the time and I remember wondering at her coyness in introducing us to her new man, J, whom she eventually married.\nJ, Cate writes, died two years ago, but not before she had nursed him for six years. She refers to him in her letter as ‘beloved J’, so presumably this third marriage was a successful one.\nCate needs our help, she writes in her letter. Could we do her a favour? She turns seventy soon and although she does not imagine she will die in the next little while, anything is possible. For long and complicated reasons, which she does not go into, Cate has lost touch with her children, all three of them, two daughters and a son, children who must by now be aged in their mid to late forties.\nCould we please help? Cate asks. Could we ‘discreetly’ and ‘sensitively’ make contact with her children and let them know that she loves them and would like at least to have an address for them.\nCate’s solicitor has told her there is no point in listing her children in her will if she has no contact address for any of them.\nCate would love to see her children, she writes, if they are willing, but she does not expect them to come running. She wants only to know how they are going and would hate for them to be left full regret after her death.\nI rang a friend who might have known a contact address for at least one of these children but she too has lost touch and suggested I ring the first ex husband, a distant and mutual friend, who lives in Melbourne.\nIt gets sticky and tricky here. I am fearful of how Cate’s ex husband might respond were I to ring out of the blue and put in a request to him for a phone number for his children in order to enable them to resume contact with their estranged mother if they should wish.\n‘I have not always been the best of mothers,’ Cate writes.\nWhich one of us has? I think.\nThis other friend who has also lost contact with Cate’s children and advises me to ask the first ex husband, warns me that Cate is ‘manipulative’.\nI know the word well. It is a feature I have detected in myself. I inherited it from my mother, a state of mind that says you dare not ask for something directly, you can only safely work your way around to getting someone to give you something or do something for you, by stealth.\nI try not to get into manipulations these days. To me the tendency to manipulate is the tendency of a weak person who lacks in confidence sufficient to cope with the consequences of a direct question, whether positive or negative.\nI suspect women of my mother’s generation were more heavily into manipulation than today because before the advent of feminism and the beginnings of a deeper awareness of the rights of women, at least in western culture, they could only get what they wanted by stealth or feminine guile.\nIt would not have done for a woman of my mother’s generation to be to open with her desires. She would have needed to obscure them, perhaps even from herself.\nGood luck with the problems that Cate's request poses.\nI don't think you should assist in this way. If she wishes to make peace she should do it herself. Any half decent detective could find them pretty easily.\nAs to the will she can simply list their names and direct the executor to search for for them dutifully.\nI showed your post to my husband and he said, \"Has Cate looked up her kids on Facebook and tried to friend them?\"\nRespectful decline Cates request as it could get real messy and ugly. You could get stuck right in the middle of a family dispute, believe it's not a nice place to be :-).\nI'm not sure if you're asking, but I would hesitate to get involved under the circumstances.\nSo far there are no problems with Cate's request, though it's early days, Elephant's Child. On the other hand, as you suggest, self deception can be dangerous. Thanks.\nGlenn above is on-the-button: Facebook of course.\nAnd I agree with Antares above as well. this whole thing smells.\nCate needs to at least MENTION her children, each by name, in her Will.\nA person who is mentioned in a Will, cannot contest it, as the mention indicates they were properly in the thoughts of the author.\nYou're not the first to suggest I should not help out here, Laoch, though I feel inclined to at least let it be known that this mother is trying to contact her children. Beyond that I'll do nothing.\nWe all manipulate. We manipulate with reason as much as we do with emotion but the emotional manipulators usually get the most flack. I would suspect that, of the two, it is the most common as not everyone is capable of intellectual reasoning to that level but I don’t think one is worse than another; it all depends on intent. Either way it’s easy to see people who try and get us to do things we would rather not do as aggressors.\nMy daughter says of me, “You do good guilt,” by which she means I know exactly what buttons to press with her. And I do. Like me she has a natural propensity to feel guilt and so it take no great skill and very little effort to make her feel guilty; it’s bubbling under the lid anyway. And so I have to tread carefully. She expects to get an Upper Second Class Honours for her Psychology Degree and I’m proud of her because she’ll have done that whilst holding down a fulltime job. A 2:1 is good, but it’s not a First. And she knows it. So I don’t know if my eyes gave me away or what – you can do so little about body language – but I did my best to be genuinely pleased. And I am. I think I am. I don’t know what I am.\nAlthough I “do good guilt” I’m not sure that I abuse that power. If I want people to do things I’m more likely to reason with them. I manipulate with logic but I don’t feel so bad about that. I trust reason; reason is honest. Emotions an notoriously unreliable. I’ve seen some very dirty fighters though and it does tend to be women but I guess that’s because they lack physical power or feel they don’t have a position of equal authority in the family and so they resort to “underhanded” methods. My mother most certainly did, or tried to do. But of course a manipulator is only effective if they know their target’s triggers. My mother would send me to Coventry (give me the silent treatment) for days and it had no effect on me whatsoever. It should have had but I knew I could last longer than she could. The same happened at work once. For some reason I crossed a picket line (not like me to be so principled) and my group ostracised me. Several weeks later my boss approached me on their behalf wanting to put an end to all hostilities. I’d worn them down, not the other way round.\nThis doesn’t mean that I’m not susceptible to being manipulated because for years I allowed my father to do exactly that. He used religion as his implement of choice. Most bullies have their gangs just in case they’re not intimidating on their own and most thugs will have a heavy standing at their shoulder. And they don’t get heavier that God Almighty. He didn’t need to scream, rant or rave or hold his breath until he turned blue. All he had to say was, “Well, God says…” and I didn’t have a leg to stand on.\nI think most of the time though the kind of person you’re talking about in your post rely on people’s good natures. We judge ourselves if we turn them away. It’s very clever, isn’t it? We become our own bully. Of course helping someone else makes us feel good about ourselves even (or maybe especially) if they don’t deserve our help so as long as we’re getting something out of the deal then go for it but once they begin to become a drain, that’s the time to call a halt. And be firm.\nI'm not sure of the likelihood that Cate would be on Face Book, Glenn. Maybe we're a bit behind here in Australia but many of the folks I know aged over forty won't have a bar of it, but it's otherwise a good idea.\nI don't fancy getting stuck in the middle of an ugly family dispute, Windsmoke, especially when it's not my own family, but somehow I think that's unlikely to happen.\nSo many folks advising me to take care here, Antares. you too.\nThanks for the warning but I don't think it's as dire as I perhaps made it sound.\nHmmm… bit funny that the lawyer could not track down NOK without an address.\nThe will I suspect is subterfuge, AnnODyne.\nI think Cate wants to make contact with her children. I can understand that.\nI can also understand that something's gone wrong along the way and those kids might elect to continue to avoid her, but it might help for them to know that they are still in their mother's thoughts, whatever that might mean.\nHas she tried the obvious things like the phone book or just googling their names?\nI suspect those kids don't want to be contacted as they are old enough to have made the move themselves if they wanted to. However, that is beside the point. I think as long as you don't get drawn into the family drama, then go ahead and make that first contact. Perhaps the olive branch she offers might be accepted – and that would be something good to hold on to.\nOnce upon a time I would have called the ex and asked for contact details. Now I would pass the ex's number on to cate. If she really wants to know, she will call him. He might even welcome the call after such a long 'cooling off' period!\nA lawyer (I'm assuming that what a soliciter is. If not, please correct me) advising Cate to leave her kids out of the will because she doesn't know their address just doesn't ring true to me. I think she made the story up and is just afraid that if she contacts the children herself, she'll be rejected. I personally would stay out of it, but that's probably due to a flaw in my own character. If you're confident this isn't all going to blow up in your face, and you still have fond feelings for Cate, then, by all means, go ahead.\nIf I were you, I would suggest to 'Cate' that she ask her lawyer to find the children. Most lawyers and law firms use investigators who do just this kind of thing. It usually takes a day or two. Once done, she can get in touch. There are also specialists who can advise her about making contact, etc.\nIt's her responsibility, right? You can support her efforts but not do what she should do for herself.\nI don't know how to suggest this delicately, and I hope you will understand what I am saying. Could you be more apt to go to Cate's rescue (she's asked you to do more than just contact them — she wants you to smooth things over) as a way to avoid dealing with what must be very difficult feelings & thoughts about your mother dying? I think the situation with Cate could be potentially very draining and therefore harmful to you at a time when you might need to conserve your energies for your own things. It sounds like the kind of situation that could snowball into something much bigger very quickly. You're a kind, generous person. Be so to yourself, too. And take care.\nThis out of my realm to offer any good solutions. Go with your guts Elisabeth on what you think is best and what you would like to do for Cate. I know she could and should have done this herself but even if you want to try to help, it is not really wrong.\nThis is just sad and puts you in an awkward position.\nIf the prospect of an inheritance won't flush them out nothing will.\nI tried to Google the next of kin, Christine and it wasn't easy. The family name is commonplace and the two daughters are likely to have changed theirs while the son lives overseas and is out of touch with both parents.\nIt would take something more I suspect to track down these children, who may yet not want to be located.\nI assume Cate's tried those things, Marie, though as I said to Christine earlier I tried, too, without success.\nIt's most likely that the kids don't want to be contacted but I think an olive branch or two might help and if not, so be it.\nI hope I don't end up in the 'discard pile', Steven, but my contact with these people in recent years is very limited and it will not be too upsetting if no one wants to make contact with me anymore, though I can't see why they would dish me.\nI am merely the messenger and I'm offering a brief and indirect message and then bowing out.\nI almost lost track of your wonderful comment, Jim, but found it again just now.\nI know all about doing a guilt trip on my children, I do it from time to time and always try to drag myself and them back out of the morass of such awful pressurizing.\nMy mother did it to me, too.\n'I didn't think \"you'd\" be like that,' she'd say. 'The others yes, but not you.' In others words: my little girl is a good girl, she'd never do anything like that, namely anything I would not expect of her.\nOur emotions guide us into deciding how best to react, if we can exoerience first and then think about them.\nWithout emotions we are in trouble. There are countless examples of psychopaths and sociopaths who are fantastic at reasoning, and all their arguments might make sense at the level of logic but they are devoid of feeling and are therefore dangerous.\nEmotions distinguish us from the robotic, or to some extent from animals, though my hunch is that animals can feel more than we often recognise.\nI'd agree, Stafford, but I suspect Cate knows her ex's number but is too fearful to call him, even with time there's still all that water under the bridge.\nI have since spoken to the Cate's ex and he has assured me he will pass on the message to his children, the two with whom he still has contact and presumably he suggests they will want to talk to me. We shall see. If they don't make contact, I'll leave it there.\nLawyers and solicitors are one and the same here, Kirk and yes, I agree I think the lawyer story might be not entirely accurate, but it may have been a trigger to resume contact.\nSomething has happened to cause Cate to write such a long letter after all this time. I doubt that it's malicious.\nI hope that's not too Pollyana-ish of me.\nMaybe this happens a lot in your part of the world, Mim. I'm not sure, but here as far as i know lawyers tend to expect more of their clients.\nA private investigator might do the job for a price but people here, as far as I know are reluctant to appoint detectives. They'll go through friends first.\nPlease don't worry too much about me, Lynn. I'm not planing on getting myself embroiled in other people's messes. You're right i have enough of my own.\nA phone call is about the extent of it. In fact I've made the call and if the children don't get back to me as a consequence, I'll leave it there. I'll write Cate a latter and tell her there's nothing more I can do.\nI have gone with my guts Fazlisa and so far nothing dreadful has happened nor do I expect it will.\nIt'd be good if something good could come out of it but I'm not counting my chickens, as the saying goes.\nIt has felt an awkward position, Mami and it is very very sad, but as everyone here suggests, it's not for me to intervene beyond a minimal response if necessary. The sadness is for this other estranged family.\nI'm not so sure that it will be much of an inheritance, RH, at least not literally, though there might be other, and to my way of thinking better rewards out of resuming contact, but not if people feel too hurt and bitter or if they are too damaged.\nWhat's a better reward than money?\nWhere do you live, Mars?\nIn your terms I probably live on Mars RH, and here I can't but quote from Oscar Wilde who wrote words to the effect that 'the cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing'.\nThere are things worth more than money."

    "text": "In our last Community Broadband Bits podcast, Christopher and I discussed the August 10th U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decision to reverse the FCC’s February 2015 ruling against state barriers. We mentioned Harold Feld’s article about the ruling posted on his website. In keeping with most matters of importance in the municipal Internet network field, Harold expertly sums up the history of the case, the arguments, and what the outcome could mean for the future.\nFeld gets down into the crux of the argument that won over the three judges in the Sixth Circuit - the need to establish if it is states or federal agencies that make the decisions regarding whether or not local governments can provide telecommunications.\nDetermining the answer was a multi-step process and Feld explains how the FCC came to the conclusion that they had the authority to preempt the laws and the states' arguments against it. This was, after all, a test case and Feld describes why the FCC chose Chattanooga and Wilson.\nAs with most things worth doing in policy land, it’s disheartening that it’s an uphill fight to get to rational policy. The idea that states should tell local people in local communities that they can’t invest in their own local infrastructure runs against traditional Republican ideas about small government and local control as it does against traditional Democratic ideas about the responsibility of government to provide basic services and promote competition. But that’s how things work in public policy sometimes. We can either give up and take what we get, or keep pushing until we change things for the better.\nIt has been several weeks, but Lisa and I wanted to answer any lingering questions people may have about the results of the Sixth Circuit case reviewing the FCC's action to remove state-created barriers to municipal networks. We devoted Community Broadband Bits episode 217 to the case and aftermath.\nThe Sixth Circuit ruled against the FCC narrowly - finding that while it had no dispute with the FCC's characterization of municipal networks as beneficial, Congress had not given the FCC the power to overrule state management of its subdivisions (cities). As we have often said, restricting local authority in this manner may be stupid, but states are allowed to do stupid things (especially when powerful companies like AT&T and Comcast urge them to).\nLisa and I explore the decision and explain why we are nonetheless glad that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and Commissioners Rosenworcel and Clyburn moved on the petitions from Chattanooga and Wilson to remove state barriers to next-generation network investment. We also reference this blog post from Harold Feld, which is a well-done summary of the situation.\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued their order on August 10th supporting the states of Tennessee and North Carolina in their challenge from an FCC decision from February 2015. Both states objected to the FCC’s decision to preempt state laws preventing municipalities from providing fast, affordable, reliable connectivity via municipal Internet networks. The Appellate Court Judges reviewed the legal arguments, the precedent, and the interplay between federal authority and state sovereignty.\nThe impact of their ruling will affect more than a few pages in a law school text book. Access to high-quality Internet access positively impacts real people and businesses and, as Cecila Kang captures in her recent article in the New York Times, the people who depend on it fear the outcome if their state legislators take it away.\n“We’re very worried because there is no way we could run this equipment on the internet service we used to have, and we can’t imagine the loss we’ll have to the business,” said Charlotte Vick, head of sales for the farm.\nAs Kang notes in her article, the FCC has no plans to appeal the decision, so battles will resume at the state level. Advocates will need to be twice as vigilant because incumbents - the only ones that come out ahead from this decision - may try to push state legislators for even tougher anti-competitive state barriers.\nEPB customers love the fast, affordable, reliable Internet access they get from their muni and they appreciate the way its smart-grid helps them save money on their electric bill. According to a new J.D. Power report, their municipal utility is also the highest rated mid-size utility in the South for customer service and reliability.\nJust a month ago, Consumer Reports magazine rated EPB the best TV and Internet access utility in the county for customer satisfaction, as chosen by a reader survey. The J.D. Power report went on to rank EPB number two in the country in the category of municipal or investor-owned electric utility.\nThe Times Free Press reports that in 2015 EPB Fiber Optics earned a net income of $23.5 million while the electric division earned $3.5 million. EPB President David Wade said that the smart-grid has reduced power outages by 60 percent and contributed to customer satisfaction by enhancing reliability of the system.\n\"The lesson that utilities can learn from other high-performing service providers is that to excel you need a culture that puts customers and employees first,\" said John Hazen, senior director of the utility practice at J.D. Power. \"And because customer expectations continue to increase, you need to have a mindset of continuous improvement to keep up.\"\nEPB Chairman Joe Ferguson said the favorable grades from EPB customers reflect the utility's local ownership, public service and management focus on serving the customer.\nMinneapolis, MN - The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decided today to dismiss the FCC's February 2015 decision to encourage Internet investment in Tennessee and North Carolina. Tennessee and North Carolina had both restricted local authority to build competitive networks.\n\"We're disappointed that the FCC's efforts to ensure local Internet choice have been struck down,\" says Christopher Mitchell with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \"We thank the FCC for working so hard to fight for local authority and we hope that states themselves will recognize the folly of defending big cable and telephone monopolies and remove these barriers to local investment. Communities desperately need these connections and must be able to decide for themselves how to ensure residents and businesses have high quality Internet access.\"\nILSR and Next Century Cities filed an Amicus brief in support of the FCC's position. View the Court's Opinion here.\nDisappointing news from the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals today as the Court chooses to reverse the FCC’s February 2015 preemption order that peeled back restrictive state laws in Tennessee and North Carolina. We have the opinion for you to download and review. You can also view the decision at the Sixth Circuit's website.\nWe consider the Sixth Circuit’s decision disappointing, incorrect, and we hope the FCC and the cities of Chattanooga and Wilson appeal this decision. Local connectivity and telecommunications should be determined by the people who will be affected by their own decisions, not by officials who are distant, unaware of local matters, and lobbied by rich corporate Internet Service Providers with an interest in limiting competition.\nIn their statement, Next Century Cities, who joined us in filing an Amicus Brief, said, \"Today’s court ruling is a setback in the fight to ensure access to next-generation broadband for more Americans, and Next Century Cities is disappointed by this decision.\"\n“Today’s ruling doesn’t change the fact that these laws were hurting communities in Tennessee and North Carolina. They were written by telecom industry lobbyists to protect incumbents like AT&T and Comcast from competition. Similar laws exist in other states, and they all need to go. State legislatures should repeal these laws and replace them with ones that promote competition and consumer choice.\nThe results of a statewide Tennessee survey on residential and business connectivity are in and they ain't pretty. Thirteen percent of the state - more than 834,000 people - don’t have access to 25 Megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload, which is the FCC's definition of broadband. Authors of the study make a number of recommendations, the first of which is removing state barriers that stifle Internet infrastructure investment.\n\"...A More Open Regulatory Environment\"\nThe study, commissioned by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) earlier this year, includes feedback from more than 23,000 households and businesses.\nThe State of Tennessee could consider lifting administrative burdens and restrictions to broadband infrastructure investment to fostering a more open regulatory environment.\nIn the report, the authors provide detailed reasoning for why the state should embrace an open regulatory environment to encourage competition. They note that state barriers impact electric cooperatives, municipalities that operate electric utilities and cannot expand beyond their own service areas, and municipalities that do not operate electric utilities but can only build telecommunications infrastructure in unserved areas with a private partner.\nThe FCC came to the same conclusion in February 2015 and rolled back Tennessee state laws in order to encourage competition. Tennessee is leading the charge against the FCC's decision with North Carolina (even though NC's Attorney General criticized the law). The parties have filed briefs, attorneys have presented oral arguments, and now the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the case."

On the catwalk of the biggest fashion houses we saw bright colors combined with each others. They call it ‘colorblocking’. And also soft pastel shades were combined together or with those colorblocking shades. So the designers of the Nike Air Max 1 thought: lets combine those trends into once perfect shoe.

As a result, a number of family cotton farms and other cotton businesses have been lost in recent years.\nThe NCC is U.S. cotton’s central organization, and its members include producers, ginners, cottonseed processors and merchandizers, merchants, marketing cooperatives, warehousers, and textile manufacturers. Farms and businesses directly involved in the production, distribution and processing of cotton employ more than 125,000 workers and produce direct business revenue of more than $21 billion. Accounting for the ripple effect of cotton through the broader economy, direct and indirect employment surpasses 280,000 workers with economic activity of almost $100 billion."

The firm is very aggressive in pursuing all available defenses against a myriad of alleged crimes including DWI, theft, trespassing, and drug offenses. The attorney will interview the client immediately in the course of representation, and we will seek to obtain all information in the District Attorney's file.\nFrom there, the law firm explores all options. We will never tell a client to accept a plea. The bottom line is that a criminal defense attorney must be willing to take a case to trial. Otherwise, prosecutors become very smart at figuring out the defense attorney who is bluffing. Prosecutors who sense fear are less likely to compromise on parameters with wide ranges such as fines, probation time, and downgrading of Class A and Class B misdemeanors.\nNo one is above being wrongfully prosecuted - it happens all the time. What you need to know to give your criminal defense attorney a fighting chance is the following Criminal Bill of Rights. Keep this language on a piece of paper in your wallet and refer to it any time you are stopped.\nMy lawyer has told me NOT to talk to anyone about my case, NOT to answer questions, and NOT to reply to accusations.\nI REFUSE TO CONSENT TO ANY SEARCH.\nCall my lawyer if you want to ask me any questions, search me or my property, or do any tests or other ID procedures.\nI DO NOT WAIVE ANY OF MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.\nDo you know how many accused people fail to follow the simple instructions above ? They talk to people about their case, specifically the arresting officer. They answer questions posed them by legal authorities and they reply to accusations.\nThey unwittingly consent to searches despite their constitutional right to refuse. They take tests not knowing that such tests are designed to enhance the appearance of guilt.\nPerhaps there is a little part in all of us that thinks, “Well, if I just do what they tell me, then they shall see it as one big mistake and let me go.” Unfortunately, that is wrong.\nFor example, when an officer tells you, \"Ok, just between you and me, do you think you have had too much to drink?\" , what the officer neglects to tell you is that there is a camera and voice recorder that is recording everything including what you say. There is no such thing as \"Just between you and me\".\nThe officer is certainly not your friend. From the moment he comes into contact with you, his objective is to build a case for the Bexar County and greater San Antonio Texas District Attorney to file against you. Period. The more you talk and the more you move around allow the officer to do just that.\nIf you have been charged with a criminal offense in Bexar County or San Antonio, you must contact a San Antonio Bexar County criminal defense attorney immediately."

Since he took office, President Trump has been focused on the U.S. trade deficit and economic competition with Europe, with China, and with most of rest of the world. He imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, prompting a backlash from the European Union, which imposed its own retaliatory measures on U.S. imports. But this was not the end of it and Trump later threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe. Where do we stand now? How serious is the danger of trade war? Trump and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker seemed to reach a truce in their July 25 meeting at the White House. How durable will that truce be? How serious is the threat of a new escalation in this trade war? And what would be its consequences?\nIn this inaugural episode of The Zeitgeist, Jeff Rathke discusses transatlantic trade in the Trump era with Peter Rashish.\nSubscribe on iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, Tune In, and Stitcher."

    "text": "Online universities offer Associate Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, Master’s Degree and even online certificate programs. This is how education and technology have evolved on-campus to online campus where professional degrees and certifications can be attained.\nAn Associate Degree comes before a Bachelor’s degree. So it seems logical to earn an Associate Degree first in preparation for the Bachelor’s Degree although this isn’t always the case. Because the decision will still be yours, it depends on what career or fields match your interest, abilities and skills.\nThere are distance learning universities offering a wide selection of courses online where the curriculum is actually premeditated and enhanced from the conventional to today’s innovative approach. Aspirations to finish Accounting, Business Administration, Communication, Computer Applications, Counter Terrorism Studies, Criminal Justice, Public Health, Retail Management, Paralegal Studies and a whole lot more are just a few of the online Associate Degrees in preparation for further study in the Bachelor’s Degree level but depending on what universities are offering. Generally, there are 8 to 16-week courses available and luckily, you can find Universities online with no application fee, with book grants available and with a strong career and student support system.\nSelect the program you desire. You need to consider your forte since the key to ensure a productive educational experience is to choose the right degree plan. There are more than 190 online degrees and certificates to choose from and this means a lot of thinking before you decide.\nApply Online. Once you are 100% determined to pursue an associate degree, you must complete and finally submit the online application for admission. Have a list of your previous educational attainment and academic program handy because you will need to provide these to fill in needed information. A student ID and password will be given and will be used every time you log into the e-campus. Typically, the application process takes 10 to 15 minutes.\nComplete the orientation. This usually takes 15-20 minutes. Just like enrolling in a conventional school, an online orientation is a must where academic and financial policies as well as Student Rights will be communicated to you. After finishing the orientation, you will be allowed to be admitted to the university that you desire.\nAfter completing the steps above, a member of the enrollment team will either be sending an email or will give you a call regarding the associate degree or course you enrolled in and any other inquiries you may have."

Their lightness and the gentleness of touches. The slightest of smiles.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen behind his main challenger in opinion polls ahead of next week's election but still has an easier path to form a government that would keep him in power for a record fifth term.\nThe children of murdered Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi have received million-dollar houses in the kingdom and monthly five-figure payments as compensation for the killing of their father.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party has decided to lodge objections to local election results in all 39 Istanbul districts, the 'Hurriyet' newspaper said yesterday, after results showed a narrow lead for the main opposition candidate.\nTwo Israeli researchers said yesterday they had discovered a network of hundreds of fake Twitter accounts that promoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and attacked his political rivals, a week before the election.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party is scrambling to regain lost ground in the polls by trying to paint his main rival as mentally unstable.\nA third young Palestinian has died as tens of thousands of protesters gathered near the Israeli border to mark the first anniversary of weekly demos in the Gaza Strip.\nA €388m superyacht belonging to a Russian billionaire in one of the world's costliest divorce battles has been released by a Dubai court after being impounded last year.\nAn airstrike, most likely by the Saudi-led coalition, struck near a rural hospital in northern Yemen, killing seven people including four children, according to the charity Save the Children, which supports the facility.\nSchoolsS reopened in southern Israel and traffic clogged Gaza's streets yesterday amid signs of a de-escalation from the most serious cross-border fighting in months.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned home from Washington yesterday, going straight into military consultations after a night of heavy fire as Israeli aircraft bombed Gaza targets and Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel.\nTen children, part of the same extended family, were killed by a US air strike in Afghanistan, along with three adult civilians, the United Nations has said.\nThe Israeli military said it had begun carrying out strikes on Hamas militant targets in the Gaza Strip yesterday, hours after a rocket struck a house in Israel.\nDubai's government has vigorously denied a claim by R&B singer R Kelly that he had planned concerts in the emirate after he had sought permission from a US judge to travel there despite facing sexual-abuse charges.\nThe US-backed Syrian forces' push to defeat Isil in its last bastion in Syria has been slowed by the presence of civilians and scores of prisoners held by the extremists, officials said.\nIsrael pounded Gaza with airstrikes hitting 100 locations after militants in the territory fired two rockets towards Tel Aviv, the first time the coastal city has been targeted since the war in 2014.\nIsil faced imminent defeat in its final enclave last night as hundreds of jihadist fighters and their families surrendered and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) claimed the battle was as good as over.\nIsraeli troops shot dead a Palestinian man after he ran at them with a knife in the Israeli-occupied West Bank yesterday, the military said.\nAir strikes by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 22 civilians, including women and children, in a village in northern Yemen, the United Nations said.\nIn Baghuz, a single black flag fluttered yesterday in a light afternoon breeze above wrecked vehicles and improvised tents - the last Isil banner flying over the last of its territory east of the Euphrates.

If they are not on our news channels, the assumption is that they have gone away. Yet the reality is that they are locked into struggles that they see on millenarian timelines in advance of God's greater glory.\nShamima Begum and her newborn baby are thought to have been moved from a Syrian refugee camp after they were \"threatened\", her family's lawyer has said.\nUnited Nations investigators said Israeli security forces may have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in killing 189 Palestinians and wounding more than 6,100 at weekly protests in Gaza last year.\nAt least 10 people were killed and more than 20 injured when a fire broke out at the main train station in Egypt's capital on Wednesday, two medical sources said.\nA Saudi princess has been named as the country's first ever female ambassador and its next envoy to the United States.\nA devastating fire has raced through densely packed buildings in a centuries-old shopping district in Bangladesh's capital, killing at least 70 people, officials said.\nIsil appeared closer to defeat in its last enclave in eastern Syria as a civilian convoy left the besieged area where US-backed forces estimate several hundred jihadists are still holed up.\nAround 200 families are trapped in a tiny pocket of land in Syria still controlled by Isil and are being bombed by US-led coalition forces, the UN has said.\nSaudi Arabia has agreed to free more than 2,100 Pakistani prisoners as the kingdom's crown prince concluded a visit to its nuclear-armed ally.\nOne of Israel's most prominent dovish politicians, former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, yesterday said she was leaving politics and warned \"democracy is in danger\".\nKhudida Haji has followed news of the battle for the caliphate's final stronghold more closely than most.

    "text": "Mountain biking is becoming quite prevalent out here on the Sunshine Coast with some world class facilities. We are very fortunate at Tzoonie that we have direct access to many kilometers of old logging trails ideal for biking or hiking. It is probably just a matter of time before someone develops the suicidal downhill runs that are becoming so popular around the world. There is a biking video on this website that was produced a couple of years ago that illustrates some of the trails and terrain available at the present time. A few days ago we decided to take some bikes out and do an inspection of one main trail to determine whether or not it is passable following the record rainfall we experienced early this spring. Some of the washouts were serious and most certainly offer a challenge to bikers. In spite of the damage, they are spectacular and put natures force into perspective. For guests who would prefer not to push a bike through some difficult terrain, we are suggesting that perhaps a great hike would suffice. We have a couple of destinations for lunch stops that offer incredible scenery and exploration of rain forest, creeks, etc. I am attaching a couple of photos of some of what we discovered during our exploration."

    "text": "INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: NEXT TERROR TARGET?\nAs the war on terrorism continues, security experts fear that the next battleground could be on the information infrastructure front. Such attacks could disrupt power systems, penetrate financial institutions and disable voice communications systems.\nThe United States is not producing the talent or investment needed to confront the threat. A shortage of trained information security specialists, poorly designed and tested software, and a lack of funding for security education and research poses serious risks to the country's infrastructure.\nWe have too few trained individuals who really understand the principles of security and there is almost no national investment in producing more. The incredible growth of our society's deployment of computing has too often been conducted with concerns for issues of safety, security and reliability.\nThe scope of infrastructure protection is larger than just computer security, and we should be concern with a broader scope, that could be called information assurance. Information assurance also involves issues of physical security, malicious software, privacy, software engineering, database security, network security, computer forensics, intrusion detection, and several other fields.\nAnyone who produces computer code or build systems should be aware that some practices are more dangerous than others, could cause harm to the public and infringe on privacy. Engineers in particular should have an awareness that there are areas where their expertise does not reach and they need to call in specialists.\nInformation security specialists are a scarce commodity. Of the 23 leading U.S. universities involved in computer security research, only 20 Ph.Ds were granted in the last three years. There are probably fewer than 100 faculty in the United States who really have some experience on this field. There are very few who have a broad view and actually can address the whole area.\nInstead of finding ways to design new systems resistant to attack, must of the effort is directed at how to apply new patches to the same old, buggy code. This does not serve to fix the long-term problems. The immediate problems of cyber systems can be patched by implementing best practices, but these will not address the fundamental problems of cyberterrorism.\n· Interruption: An asset of the system is destroyed or becomes unavailable or unusable. This is referred to as an attack on availability. Examples include destruction of a piece of hardware, such as a hard disk, the cutting of a communication line, or the disabling of the file management system.\n· Fabrication: The attacker inserts counterfeit objects into the system. This is referred to as an attack on authenticity. Examples include the insertion of spurious messages in a network or the addition of records to a file.\nA useful categorization of these attacks is in terms of passive attacks and active attacks. Passive attacks are in the nature of monitoring of transmissions. The goal of the attacker is to obtain information that is being transmitted. Two types of passive attacks are(1) release of message content;(2) traffic analysis. A release of message content is easily understood. A telephone conversation, an electronic mail message, and a transferred file may contain sensitive or confidential information.\nThe second passive attack, traffic analysis, is more subtle. Suppose that we had a way of masking the contents of a message or other information traffic so that Cuba, even if they capture the information, could not extract the real information because of the use of encryption. The attacker could after a period of time extract the information and messages, defeating the encryption process.\nThe second major category of attack is active attacks. These attacks involve some modification of the data stream or the creation of a false stream. It can be subdivided into four categories: masquerade, replay, modification of message, denial of service.\nA masquerade takes place when the attacker, under certain entity, pretends to be a different entity, and therefore enabling an authorized entity to obtain extra privileges. Replay involves the passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent retransmission to produce an unauthorized effect.\nModification of service simply means that some portion of a legitimate message is altered, or that messages are delayed or reordered, to produce an unauthorized effect. The denial of service prevents or inhibits the normal use or management of communications facilities. This is a very important and serious possible attack. It could disrupt an entire network, either by disabling the network or by overloading it with messages so as to degrade performance. The attacker could target airports, financial centers, power companies, dams control centers, etc. It is quite difficult to prevent active attacks. The goal is to detect them and to recover from any disruption or delays caused by them.\nThe objective of the intruder is to gain access to a system or to increase the range of privileges accessible on a system. The intruder must acquired information that should have been protected. In most cases, this information is in the form of a password. The password file can be protected by one way encryption or by limiting the access control to the file. What are the most common techniques used so far to try to break into a system?\nNetwork security has assumed increasing importance. Individuals, corporations, government agencies, must heighten their awareness to protect data and messages, and to protect systems from network-based attacks. The disciplines of cryptography and network security have matured, leading to the development of practical, readily available applications to enforce network security."

    "text": "The hands-on race car, it is a beauty, use electric tape to decorate it the way you find most pleasing, and add some bows as streamers!\nThis is what you need: two plastic tubs and lids about 4 cm deep and 12 cm in diameter, you can get them at any delicatessen counter of store, two small canning lids, two roofing nails or screws that have the same approximate size, a steel wire coat hanger from the dry cleaners, some plywood and the car body which is a piece of wood about 2×4 cm and 30 cm long. You can get that as a trimming from a carpenter or ask a friend.\nThis is one rear wheel, note the lid is on the plastic tub and we have decorated the rims with electric tape. If you pull the take hard it will follow the edge of the lid and the top or the tub. At the centre of the bottom of the tub and the centre of the lid, burn a hole with a heated piece of coat hanger wire. You need some help from an adult, use a candle or small gas burner or barbecue lighter to heat the tip of the wire.\nPush the coat hanger axle through the hole and put on a washer made of a short section of a straw.\nThe tail end of the car body with a slot for the stabilizer The slot is cut into the wood with a saw and it should be about the same width as the thickness of the stabilizer.\nThe front wheels go on next, they are two canning lids, put the rubber on the outside and use a roofing nail to fix the wheels to the body, use the pre-drilled hole. Make sure that you do not hammer the nails in all the way because the wheels won’t turn then.\nThe stabilizer goes into the slot at the rear end of the body, make sure the hole in the stabilizer is at the back and at the top, make a little grove with a file in the bottom for the elastic to fit iin when you launch the car. You might sand or file the edge of the this plywood stabilizer a little to better fit into the slot.\nThe launch pad is a piece of plywood or about 10 centimeters wide and about 45 centimeters long, at one end cut two small slots with a fine saw where the elastic then can be pulled into just as in the illustration. Call this an “Impuls” device and you will impress everybody!\nThis is the way you launch the car, note the elastic is slung around the bottom of the stabiliser with one hand you hold down the launch pad and with the other you pull the car and elastic all the way back to the end of the launch pad, it might take some tries, but the car should go fast!"

    "text": "Home » Blogs » Charles Gaba's blog » Dear Democratic Candidates: Time to Play Offense on the ACA.\nHowever, for those of you who aren't doing so yet, you should be aware that your own House Energy & Commerce Committee caucus has thoughtfully posted a handy report breaking down ACA enrollments by every US Congressional District.\nThere are 25,000 district residents who were previously uninsured but now have quality, affordable health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\nOverall, the number of uninsured district residents has declined by 27%.\nApproximately 22,600 individuals purchased quality, affordable coverage through the new health insurance marketplace, 19,400 enrolled in Medicaid, and 5,400 young adults were able to retain coverage through their parents’ plans. For more than 87% of the individuals enrolled in the health insurance marketplace, financial assistance was available that could reduce the cost of the average plan to $97 per month.\n283,000 individuals in the district – including 52,000 children and 122,000 women – now have health insurance that covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductible.\n10,400 seniors in the district received Medicare Part D prescription drug discounts worth $14.1 million.\n153,000 seniors in the district are now eligible for Medicare preventive services without paying any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductible.\n235,000 individuals in the district are protected by ACA provisions that prevent insurance companies from spending more than 20% of their premiums on profits and administrative overhead. Because of these protections, over 8,400 individuals in the district received approximately $3.4 million in insurance company rebates.\nUp to 36,000 children in the district with preexisting health conditions can no longer be denied coverage by health insurers.\n235,000 individuals in the district now have insurance that cannot place annual or lifetime limits on their coverage.\nFirst, this only includes private marketplace enrollment figures through April 19th and doesn't account for those who never paid their first month's premium (around 800,000 people). The good news is that, ironically, by my calculations this number should be more than cancelled out by the additional enrollees since April 19th (around 1.3 million nationally, of which around 900K have paid). Even if I'm off by a bit one one side or the other, there's a good 100K cushion there...so yes, the number of paid enrollments as of September should be around the same as the total number listed in your district report.\nSecond, the Medicaid numbers only include the 6.7 million newly-added enrollees through May 31st, which leaves out an additional 500,000 Medicaid/CHIP enrollees from June....as well as, I'd imagine, another good half million or more from July and August. Whatever \"Medicaid/CHIP\" number is listed in your district report is almost certainly at least 15% higher by now (for states which have expanded Medicaid) or perhaps 5% higher for states which didn't.\nThe only quibble I might have with these numbers is the first one, which assumes 60% were previously uninsured based on the KFF study instead of the actual 57%. However, again, those numbers are only based on either 4/19 or 5/31 totals, so I'm certain that the 3% difference has been more than made up by now, making those numbers accurate as of September.\nThe other slightly squirrelly number is the \"young adults on their parents plan\" figure, which has been the subject of dispute since it was released. Again, however, this number is from 2 years ago (remember, some ACA provisions have been in effect since 2010), and whatever the actual number was then has certainly gone up since that time.\nIn other words, no matter what, you should be on very safe ground with the numbers in these reports. Use them.\nShould the GOP take control of the Senate, drop-off voters are most concerned that “Republicans will take away a woman’s right to choose and restrict access to birth control” (58 percent rank this very concerning), “Republicans will cut access to health care for 8 million people and let insurance companies refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions” (58 percent) and “Republicans will cut back workplace protections for women, denying equal pay for equal work” (57 percent)….\nOf course, the truth is that it's far more than 8 million people whose healthcare is at risk here. There's also another 6-7 million or so on Medicaid who'd be at risk of having their coverage yanked away as well, not to mention that millions more would be at risk of going back to the \"good old days\" when insurance companies could kick you to the curb on a whim or tell you to go pound sand if you have a pre-existing condition (that is, something which requires, you know, medical treatment).\nThe Affordable Care Act (aka \"Obamacare\", aka \"the ACA\") isn't a perfect law; no law is. However, it's still a huge improvement over what we had before, and it paves the way for an even better system going forward. That's why I support it, and that's why Democrats should be doing so loud & clear this fall."

Trying to get out of these circumstances on your own can be overwhelming. The strongest office managers know there is no shame in asking for a “helping hand” during crunch times.\n· The help can be given quickly, from a company that can not only handle the volume of your business, but can do so in a timely manner.\n· The “extra hands” cause minimal interruption or risk to your current cash flow and processes.\n· The help provides vital value beyond the pressing crisis, and gives you the most value for your dollar. True medical billing experts bring a fresh eye and state-of-the-art knowledge about the billing industry.\nThe best way to achieve these objectives is to find an outside company who will start by working on the AR that is over 60 days old, in addition to the current dates of services. By working the old AR, this will show the source of lost cash flow and give relief to a great point of aggravation.\nKnowing when to seek help, and understanding the type of help you need can turn a potential disaster into a conquest that will please physicians, provide immediate relief for the practice, and set you up for on-going medical billing and collections success.\nApplied Medical Systems has been caring for the health of practices for more than 30 years by providing billing, coding and physician practice management services solutions to various healthcare specialties across the U.S.; including hospitals, private practices and emergency department physician groups."

My two-year old has outgrown his crib and he has an amazing triple bed my husband made waiting for him. You can see pictures of the fabulous triple bed and their nautical room here.\nI have been dreaming of all the wonderful project that I could make with his old crib. I love repurposed projects! They make me feel so green and we save money. We made two projects with our crib: my husband made something really cool (stay tune for that project) and I made this Photo Wall Display. We bought the crib used and it served it’s purpose for two years and I love that we can still get some use from it.\nWhat you need to do first is take the crib apart. Ours was really easy to take apart with screws on each corner. Then take the crib railing and hang on the wall. I wanted to paint it but my husband knows I like to change the house around so he suggested that we leave it as close to its natural color so that when we are done with it we can put it back together and sell it. He’s knows me well.\nWe used to hooks that were the perfect size to keep the crib railing up on the wall.\nOnce you have it on the wall you can start adding your frames. I just used the picture stand attached on the back of the frame to hold the picture up in each slot. No need for nails.\nI especially love my DIY $1 frames make over. You will never guess what I used to for the design cover on the frames. Stay tune for the details."

    "text": "When I firstÂ saw a picture of this undeniably creative hot dog cake, my first reaction was that it would be great to take to a barbecue or other cookout where real hot dogs are already on the menu. The cake is made by sculpting a pound cake into a hamburger bun shape and laying a generously frosted cake hot dog in the middle of it, to be topped with yellow icing “mustard” and gumdrop “onions” and “relish.” It looks oh-so-festive, doesn’t it?\nMy second reaction to this cake was one of mild disgust because the “hot dog” is made of Twinkies. Twinkies might be tasty (albeit unhealthy) snack cakes on their own, but the idea of a cream-filled hot dog – even one that is just made up to look like a hot dog – is just not appetizing.\nStill, I’d definitely attempt this creation with homemade counterparts for a bbq. I’d start with a basic pound cake, carve out the bun, then shape the carved out portion into my “hot dog,” rather than adding Twinkies into the mix."

    "text": "Italy is facing a crisis in the health sector, as around 53,000 nurses are needed across the country. The alert is provided by the Nurses Order, according to which the active nurses are obliged to attend up to 11 patients simultaneously, even in some areas a nurse is responsible for up to 17 patients.\nAccording to the Nursing Order, in the analyzes of all regions of Italy, the most positive results are presented only in some northern provinces where a nurse is registered for three patients. The situation is also worrying in Lombardia, where there are the best hospitals in the national level, but there are about 4800 nurses in these hospitals.\nAccording to the authorities, these figures have serious consequences, as risks increase for the sick but also for the nurses themselves. The fact that about 40 percent of Italian nurses are forced to spend extra hours to cover the needs of patients, explains a lot.\nThe Order of Nurses requires the issue to be resolved and called an urgent meeting to review this situation with Health Minister Giulia Grillo, and representatives of all Italian provinces. Of course one of the alternatives to solving the crisis is the recruitment of nurses in neighboring countries, such as Albania."

You file an application and several days later the company HR director calls you in for a talk. You are not surprised to learn you’re not the only applicant. The competition is going to be pretty stiff. But you go in and meet the HR person who thinks you’re worth a talk with one of the office managers of this big company. The HR person warns you this person is kind of tough so you ask some friends to speak up on your behalf. They and you are persuasive enough that the office manager sets up a meeting with the Division Director. But the office manager tells you to lose the sport coat, get a suit and a new tie, and shine your shoes. The competition gets tougher the higher you go and you want to make sure you stand out enough to be memorable to the Division Director.\nThe Division Director takes a good look at you, listens to you state your case, and confers with assistants who have watched the interview. The group likes you but suggests a few tweaks you can make in your presentation and your personal appearance. Maybe they suggest a few additional details would help your resume in your next step.\nBy now the company’s date for filling this job is getting closer and you are one of a few surviving candidates. The Vice-President of the company is going to meet with all of the finalists and will recommend one to the company President and CEO. To increase the pressure on the finalists, each of them is interviewed as the others watch. The VP has to catch a plane so every extra minute the other candidates take making themselves more impressive means you have less time before the VP leaves to catch the plane. Five minutes before she has to grab her briefcase and bolt out the door, she turns to you. You have only five minutes to sum up everything that justifies your application and your abilities. Five minutes to prove you deserve to be the one who walks into the office of the President and stands at his desk as the newest important employee of the company.\nToday is that five minutes for the Missouri legislature.\nToday is the last chance for hundreds of bills to make a good enough impression to be sent to the the Governor’s desk, potentially as the newest important laws for Missouri. It’s the last five minutes of the long process and all of the company VPs go out the door at 6 p.m.\n. . . . and the applicant’s name is . . wait for it . . . “Bill”."

    "text": "Amateur astronomers never know what signals they might pick up.\nA satellite lost 13 years ago was just, briefly, found. Now a group of optimistic technicians may have a chance to bring it back into the fold. In January, amateur astronomer Scott Tilley of British Columbia sat in his home, scanning radio frequencies for the U.S. Air Force satellite lost after a January 7 SpaceX launch. Tilley indeed found a lost satellite, but not the one he intended. Using a satellite catalog, he looked up its transmitter frequency and spin rate, and realized he had to alert NASA.\nBack in 2005, the space agency suddenly lost contact with IMAGE, the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration, a solar wind observer. Launched in 2000, the mission was already three years past its expected duration. Still, the team decided to try contacting it again two years later, when a 2007 eclipse cutting off the satellite’s solar-powered systems would force a reboot. But IMAGE stayed silent, and NASA declared the spacecraft lost.\nRichard Burley, former IMAGE mission director, isn’t sure how the spacecraft came online, but suspects a flaw in the power system, which the team encountered in 2004, could have been triggered again, restarting the computer and putting it into a 72-hour reboot cycle. “We cannot tell exactly how long it has been in this mode,” says Burley, but amateur astronomers have looked back at their data and found IMAGE’s signal as far back as October 2016.\nThen on February 25, IMAGE went worryingly quiet again—but not in the same manner it did in 2005, says Burley. He suspects there’s an issue with IMAGE’s spin axis in relation to its medium-gain antenna placement. If NASA can regain control of the spacecraft, it will decide if it can fund a mission restart.\nThe quixotic tale of a wayward satellite could have a happy ending yet."

    "text": "by Tom Cox MRPharmS, Lead Prison Pharmacist.\nIt’s long been recognised within prison populations that there’s a high prevalence of substance use disorder in connection with prescription medicines. This is often found alongside problematic polypharmacy situations.[i] My main objective as a Lead Prison Pharmacist is to optimise medicines and resolve problematic polypharmacy, to try and rehabilitate people held in custody.\nMedicines optimisation within a prison takes many forms, just as it does in other areas of health care. It starts with comprehensive medicines reconciliation when people arrive at the prison. Compared with the general population, people in custody have often lived chaotic lifestyles, either on the outside of prison, or perhaps in other prisons, so the first step is to understand what they have been taking, and how they have or have not been managing their medicines.\nA particular problem we encounter during medicines reconciliation is that when a person arrives in prison, they often have other people’s prescription medicines in their possession, as well as their own. This forms important evidence for any resulting medicines optimisation.\nBeing a prison pharmacist has its own set of challenges but challenges tend to reap their own rewards. Most of the time I feel like I’m making a positive difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable in society.\nI work in a Category B prison holding 445 adult male prisoners with the majority being Welsh."

Her first public presence was seen and heard via the movie Shake, Rattle and Rock, filmed during the latter part of 1956. Soon following the movie's release in April 1957 came the release of her first single. After at least 3 more releases on just as many labels, in 1960 Annita hooked up with Ray Anthony and his Bookend Revue, along with Diane Hall. Before year's end 1961, Annita and Diane left the Revue and continued performing as a duo.\nAfter a couple of years, the two women began touring on their own, performing throughout the United States and in many parts of the world, even spending two months in Vietnam in 1967. In the meantime, Annita continued recording on her own with two more singles and an album between the two. Eventually Annita and Diane began recording together for Wand Records as Diane And Annita.\nThe singer retired in 1970 and later went \"full-bore\" into commercial real estate. But her voice – the voice that once entertained thousands – started to quiver.\n\"I would be in high-powered meetings, and people thought I was nervous. But I knew what I was talking about and was completely confident,\" said Hirsch, who married attorney Ephraim Hirsch in 1976. In August 1984 she began a second career as a licensed Real Estate Broker."

    "text": "Medically reviewed by Drugs.com. Last updated on Oct 1, 2018.\nDalvance® (dalbavancin) for injection is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, S. constellatus) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains).\nTo reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Dalvance and other antibacterial agents, Dalvance should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\nThe recommended dosage regimen of Dalvance in patients with normal renal function is 1500 mg, administered either as a single dose, or 1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg. Dalvance should be administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].\nIn patients with renal impairment whose known creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min and who are not receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis, the recommended regimen of Dalvance is 1125 mg, administered as a single dose, or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg (see Table 1). No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis, and Dalvance can be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nDalvance (dalbavancin) for injection must be reconstituted with either Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and subsequently diluted only with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL.\nReconstitution: Dalvance must be reconstituted under aseptic conditions, using 25 mL of either Sterile Water for Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, for each 500 mg vial. To avoid foaming, alternate between gentle swirling and inversion of the vial until its contents are completely dissolved. Do not shake. The reconstituted vial contains 20 mg/mL dalbavancin as a clear, colorless to yellow solution.\nReconstituted vials may be stored either refrigerated at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F), or at controlled room temperature 20 to 25 °C (68 to 77 °F). Do not freeze.\nDilution: Aseptically transfer the required dose of reconstituted dalbavancin solution from the vial(s) to an intravenous bag or bottle containing 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. The diluted solution must have a final dalbavancin concentration of 1 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution.\nOnce diluted into an intravenous bag or bottle as described above, Dalvance may be stored either refrigerated at 2 to 8 °C (36 to 46 °F) or at a controlled room temperature of 20 to 25 °C (68 to 77 °F). Do not freeze.\nThe total time from reconstitution to dilution to administration should not exceed 48 hours.\nLike all parenteral drug products, diluted Dalvance should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to infusion. If particulate matter is identified, do not use.\nAdministration: After reconstitution and dilution, Dalvance is to be administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes.\nDo not co-infuse Dalvance with other medications or electrolytes. Saline-based infusion solutions may cause precipitation and should not be used. The compatibility of reconstituted Dalvance with intravenous medications, additives, or substances other than 5% Dextrose Injection, USP has not been established.\nIf a common intravenous line is being used to administer other drugs in addition to Dalvance, the line should be flushed before and after each Dalvance infusion with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.\nDalvance is supplied in clear glass vials containing sterile powder (white/off-white to pale yellow) equivalent to 500 mg of dalbavancin.\nDalvance is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to dalbavancin. No data are available on cross-reactivity between dalbavancin and other glycopeptides, including vancomycin.\nSerious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) and skin reactions have been reported in patients treated with Dalvance. If an allergic reaction occurs, treatment with Dalvance should be discontinued. Before using Dalvance, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides, and due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, exercise caution in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].\n​Dalvance is administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of Dalvance can cause reactions that resemble “Red-Man Syndrome,” including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, rash, and/or back pain. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions.\nIn Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, more Dalvance than comparator-treated subjects with normal baseline transaminase levels had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Overall, abnormalities in liver tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) were reported with similar frequency in the Dalvance and comparator arms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including Dalvance, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon, and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.\nC. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\nIf CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\nPrescribing Dalvance in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of Dalvance cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.\nAdverse reactions were evaluated for 2473 patients treated with Dalvance: 1778 patients were treated with Dalvance in seven Phase 2/3 trials comparing Dalvance to comparator antibacterial drugs and 695 patients were treated with Dalvance in one Phase 3 trial comparing Dalvance single and two-dose regimens. A causal relationship between study drug and adverse reactions was not always established. The median age of patients treated with Dalvance was 48 years, ranging between 16 and 93 years. Patients treated with Dalvance were predominantly male (59.5%) and White (81.2%).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 121/2473 (4.9%) of patients treated with any regimen of Dalvance. In the Phase 2/3 trials comparing Dalvance to comparator, serious adverse reactions occurred in 109/1778 (6.1%) of patients in the Dalvance group and 80/1224 (6.5%) of patients in the comparator group. In a Phase 3 trial comparing Dalvance single and two-dose regimens, serious adverse reactions occurred in 7/349 (2.0%) of patients in the Dalvance single dose group and 5/346 (1.4%) of patients in the Dalvance two-dose group. Dalvance was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 64/2473 (2.6%) patients treated with any regimen of Dalvance. In the Phase 2/3 trials comparing Dalvance to comparator, Dalvance was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 53/1778 (3.0%) of patients in the Dalvance group and 35/1224 (2.9%) of patients in the comparator group. In a Phase 3 trial comparing Dalvance single and two-dose regimens, Dalvance was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 6/349 (1.7%) of patients in the Dalvance single dose group and 5/346 (1.4%) of patients in the Dalvance two-dose group.\nThe most common adverse reactions in patients treated with Dalvance were nausea (4.7%), headache (3.8%), and diarrhea (3.4%). The median duration of adverse reactions was 3.0 days in patients treated with Dalvance. In the Phase 2/3 trials comparing Dalvance to comparator, the median duration of adverse reactions was 3.0 days for patients in the Dalvance group and 4.0 days in patients in the comparator group. In a Phase 3 trial comparing Dalvance single and two-dose regimens, the median duration of adverse reactions was 3.0 days for patients in the Dalvance single and two-dose group.\nTable 2 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with Dalvance in Phase 2/3 clinical trials.\n* Comparators included linezolid, cefazolin, cephalexin, and vancomycin.\nIn the Phase 3 trial comparing the single and two-dose regimen of Dalvance, the adverse reaction that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with Dalvance was nausea (3.4% in the Dalvance single dose group and 2% in the Dalvance two-dose group).\nAmong patients with normal baseline ALT levels treated with Dalvance 17 (0.8%) had post-baseline ALT elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) including five subjects with post-baseline ALT values greater than 10 times ULN. Among patients with normal baseline ALT levels treated with non-Dalvance comparators 2 (0.2%) had post-baseline ALT elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. Fifteen of the 17 patients treated with Dalvance and one comparator patient had underlying conditions which could affect liver enzymes, including chronic viral hepatitis, history of alcohol abuse and metabolic syndrome. In addition, one Dalvance-treated subject in a Phase 1 trial had post-baseline ALT elevations greater than 20 times ULN. ALT elevations were reversible in all subjects with follow-up assessments. No comparator-treated subject with normal baseline transaminases had post-baseline ALT elevation greater than 10 times ULN.\nThe following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of dalbavancin. Because the reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Back pain as an infusion-related reaction [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\nDrug-laboratory test interactions have not been reported. Dalvance at therapeutic concentrations does not artificially prolong prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).\nNo clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with Dalvance. There is minimal potential for drug-drug interactions between Dalvance and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) substrates, inhibitors, or inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nThere have been no adequate and well-controlled studies with Dalvance in pregnant women. Dalvance should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nNo treatment-related malformations or embryo-fetal toxicity were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits at clinically relevant exposures of dalbavancin. Treatment of pregnant rats with dalbavancin at 3.5 times the human dose on an exposure basis during early embryonic development and from implantation to the end of lactation resulted in delayed fetal maturation and increased fetal loss, respectively [see Data].\nThe background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.\nNo evidence of embryo or fetal toxicity was found in the rat or rabbit at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day (1.2 and 0.7 times the human dose on an exposure basis, respectively). Delayed fetal maturation was observed in the rat at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day (3.5 times the human dose on an exposure basis).\nIn a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, increased embryo lethality and increased offspring deaths during the first week post-partum were observed at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day (3.5 times the human dose on an exposure basis).\nIt is not known whether dalbavancin or its metabolite is excreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when Dalvance is administered to a nursing woman.\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Dalvance and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Dalvance or from the underlying maternal condition.\nDalbavancin is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.\nSafety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.\nOf the 2473 patients treated with Dalvance in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, 403 patients (16.3%) were 65 years of age or older. The efficacy and tolerability of Dalvance were similar to comparator regardless of age. The pharmacokinetics of Dalvance was not significantly altered with age; therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary based on age alone.\nDalvance is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in this age group.\nIn patients with renal impairment whose known creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min and who are not receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis, the recommended regimen for Dalvance is 1125 mg, administered as a single dose, or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg. No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis, and Dalvance can be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nNo dosage adjustment of Dalvance is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Caution should be exercised when prescribing Dalvance to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) as no data are available to determine the appropriate dosing in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nSpecific information is not available on the treatment of overdose with Dalvance, as dose-limiting toxicity has not been observed in clinical studies. In Phase 1 studies, healthy volunteers have been administered cumulative doses of up to 4500 mg over a period of up to 8 weeks, with no signs of toxicity or laboratory results of clinical concern.\nTreatment of overdose with Dalvance should consist of observation and general supportive measures. Although no information is available specifically regarding the use of hemodialysis to treat overdose, in a Phase 1 study in patients with renal impairment less than 6% of the recommended dalbavancin dose was removed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nDalvance (dalbavancin) for injection is a lipoglycopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Nonomuraea species.\nDalbavancin is a mixture of five closely related active homologs (A0, A1, B0, B1, and B2); the component B0 is the major component of dalbavancin. The homologs share the same core structure and differ in the fatty acid side chain of the N-acylaminoglucuronic acid moiety (R1) structure and/or the presence of an additional methyl group (R2) on the terminal amino group (shown in the Figure 1 and Table 3 below).\nThe B0 INN chemical name is: 5,31-dichloro-38-de(methoxycarbonyl)-7-demethyl-19-deoxy-56-O-[2-deoxy-2-[(10-methylundecanoyl)amino]-β-D-glucopyranuronosyl]-38-[[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] carbamoyl]-42-O-α-D-mannopyranosyl-15-N-methyl(ristomycin A aglycone) hydrochloride.\nDalvance is supplied in clear glass vials as a sterile, lyophilized, preservative-free, white to off-white to pale yellow solid. Each vial contains dalbavancin HCl equivalent to 500 mg of dalbavancin as the free base, plus lactose monohydrate (129 mg) and mannitol (129 mg) as excipients. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust the pH at the time of manufacture. The powder is to be reconstituted and further diluted for IV infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].\nDalbavancin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].\nThe antibacterial activity of dalbavancin appears to best correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus based on animal models of infection. An exposure-response analysis of a single study in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections supports the two-dose regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\nCardiac Electrophysiology: In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled, thorough QT/QTc study, 200 healthy subjects received dalbavancin 1000 mg IV, dalbavancin 1500 mg IV, oral moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo. Neither dalbavancin 1000 mg nor dalbavancin 1500 mg had any clinically relevant adverse effect on cardiac repolarization.\nDalbavancin pharmacokinetic parameters have been characterized in healthy subjects, patients, and specific populations. Pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of single intravenous 1000 mg and 1500 mg doses were as shown in Table 4. The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin can be described using a three-compartment model.\n1 Data from 50 healthy subjects.\n2 Data from 12 healthy subjects.\n3 Based upon population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from patients, the effective half-life is approximately 8.5 days (204 hours).\n4 Data from 49 healthy subjects.\nIn healthy subjects, dalbavancin AUC0-24h and Cmax both increased proportionally to dose following single IV dalbavancin doses ranging from 140 mg to 1500 mg, indicating linear pharmacokinetics.\nThe mean plasma concentration-time profile for dalbavancin following the recommended two-dose regimen of 1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Mean (± standard deviation) dalbavancin plasma concentrations versus time in healthy subjects (n=10) following IV administration over 30 minutes of 1000 mg dalbavancin (Day 1) and 500 mg dalbavancin (Day 8).\nNo apparent accumulation of dalbavancin was observed following multiple IV infusions administered once weekly for up to eight weeks, with 1000 mg on Day 1 followed by up to seven weekly 500 mg doses, in healthy adults with normal renal function.\nDistribution: Dalbavancin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. The plasma protein binding of dalbavancin is approximately 93% and is not altered as a function of drug concentration, renal impairment, or hepatic impairment. The mean concentrations of dalbavancin achieved in skin blister fluid remain above 30 mg/L up to 7 days (approximately 146 hours) post dose, following 1000 mg IV dalbavancin. The mean ratio of the AUC0-144 hrs in skin blister fluid/AUC0-144 hrs in plasma is 0.60 (range 0.44 to 0.64).\nMetabolism: In vitro studies using human microsomal enzymes and hepatocytes indicate that dalbavancin is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 isoenzymes. A minor metabolite of dalbavancin (hydroxy-dalbavancin) has been observed in the urine of healthy subjects. Quantifiable concentrations of the hydroxy-dalbavancin metabolite have not been observed in human plasma (lower limit of quantitation = 0.4 µg/mL) [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\nExcretion: Following administration of a single 1000 mg dose in healthy subjects, 20% of the dose was excreted in feces through 70 days post dose. An average of 33% of the administered dalbavancin dose was excreted in urine as unchanged dalbavancin and approximately 12% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolite hydroxy-dalbavancin through 42 days post dose.\nRenal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 28 subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment and in 15 matched control subjects with normal renal function.\nFollowing a single dose of 500 mg or 1000 mg dalbavancin, the mean plasma clearance (CLT) was reduced 11%, 35%, and 47% in subjects with mild (CLCR 50 to 79 mL/min), moderate (CLCR 30 to 49 mL/min), and severe (CLCR less than 30 mL/min), renal impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The clinical significance of the decrease in mean plasma CLT, and the associated increase in AUC0-∞ noted in these pharmacokinetic studies of dalbavancin in subjects with severe renal impairment has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with CLCR greater than 30 mL/min or patients receiving hemodialysis. The recommended regimen for dalbavancin in patients with severe renal impairment who are not receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis is 1125 mg, administered as a single dose, or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg.\nDalbavancin pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis (three times/week) are similar to those observed in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment, and less than 6% of an administered dose is removed after three hours of hemodialysis.\nTherefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients receiving regularly scheduled hemodialysis, and dalbavancin may be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis in such patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Overdosage (10)].\nHepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 17 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B or C) and compared to those in nine matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. The mean AUC0-336 hrs was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function; however, the mean AUC0-336 hrs decreased 28% and 31% in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The clinical significance of the decreased AUC0-336 hrs in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic function is unknown.\nNo dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when prescribing dalbavancin to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as no data are available to determine the appropriate dosing.\nGender: Clinically significant gender-related differences in dalbavancin pharmacokinetics have not been observed either in healthy subjects or in patients with infections. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender.\nGeriatric Patients: Clinically significant age-related differences in dalbavancin pharmacokinetics have not been observed in patients with infections. No dosage adjustment is recommended based solely on age.\nPediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin in pediatric populations <12 years of age have not been established.\nNonclinical studies demonstrated that dalbavancin is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 isoenzymes. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, dalbavancin pharmacokinetics were not affected by co-administration with known CYP450 substrates, inducers or inhibitors, nor by individual medications including acetaminophen, aztreonam, fentanyl, metronidazole, furosemide, proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole), midazolam, and simvastatin.\nDalbavancin, a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide, interferes with cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the stem pentapeptide in nascent cell wall peptidoglycan, thus preventing cross-linking. Dalbavancin is bactericidal in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at concentrations similar to those sustained throughout treatment in humans treated according to the recommended dosage regimen.\nThe development of bacterial isolates resistant to dalbavancin has not been observed, either in vitro, in studies using serial passage, or in animal infection experiments.\nWhen tested in vitro, dalbavancin demonstrated synergistic interactions with oxacillin and did not demonstrate antagonistic or synergistic interactions with any of the following antibacterial agents of various classes: gentamicin, vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, aztreonam, rifampin or daptomycin. The clinical significance of these in vitro findings is unknown.\nDalbavancin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].\nThe following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. In addition, at least 90% of organisms in the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the dalbavancin susceptible breakpoint of 0.25 mcg/mL. However, the safety and efficacy of dalbavancin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria have not been established in adequate well-controlled clinical trials.\nLong-term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of dalbavancin have not been conducted.\nDalbavancin was not genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay, a mammalian HGPRT gene mutation assay, an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, or an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.\nImpaired fertility in the rat was not observed at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day (1.2 times the human dose on an exposure basis). Reductions in male and female fertility and increased embryo resorptions occurred at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day (3.5 times the human dose on an exposure basis), at which signs of parental toxicity were also observed.\nIncreases in serum levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST), associated with microscopic findings in the liver were noted in toxicology studies in rats and dogs where dalbavancin was administered daily for 28 to 90 days. Hepatocellular necrosis was observed in dogs dosed at ≥10 mg/kg/day for longer than 2 months, i.e., at approximately 5 to 7 times the expected human dose on an exposure basis. Histiocytic vacuolation and hepatocyte necrosis were observed in rats dosed daily at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day, respectively, for 4 weeks, (approximately 3 and 6 times the expected human dose on an exposure basis, respectively). In addition, renal toxicity characterized by increases in serum BUN and creatinine and microscopic kidney findings was observed in rats and dogs at doses 5 to 7 times the expected human dose on an exposure basis. The relationship between these findings in the animal toxicology studies after 28 and 90 consecutive days of dosing to the indicated clinical dosing of 2 doses 7 days apart are unclear.\nAdult patients with ABSSSI were enrolled in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials of similar design (Trial 1 and Trial 2). The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included 1,312 randomized patients. Patients were treated for two weeks with either a two-dose regimen of intravenous Dalvance (1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg) or intravenous vancomycin (1000 mg or 15 mg/kg every 12 hours, with the option to switch to oral linezolid after 3 days). Dalvance-treated patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min received 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg. Approximately 5% of patients also received a protocol-specified empiric course of treatment with intravenous aztreonam for coverage of Gram-negative pathogens.\nThe specific infections in these trials included cellulitis (approximately 50% of patients across treatment groups), major abscess (approximately 30%), and wound infection (approximately 20%). The median lesion area at baseline was 341 cm2. In addition to local signs and symptoms of infection, patients were also required to have at least one systemic sign of disease at baseline, defined as temperature 38°C or higher (approximately 85% of patients), white blood cell count greater than 12,000 cells/mm3 (approximately 40%), or 10% or more band forms on white blood cell differential (approximately 23%). Across both trials, 59% of patients were from Eastern Europe and 36% of patients were from North America. Approximately 89% of patients were Caucasian and 58% were males. The mean age was 50 years and the mean body mass index was 29.1 kg/m2.\nThe primary endpoint of these two ABSSSI trials was the clinical response rate where responders were defined as patients who had no increase from baseline in lesion area 48 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy, and had a temperature consistently at or below 37.6° C upon repeated measurement. Table 5 summarizes overall clinical response rates in these two ABSSSI trials using the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint in the ITT population.\n1 There were 7 patients who did not receive treatment and were counted as non-responders: 6 Dalvance patients (3 in each trial) and one vancomycin/linezolid patient in Trial 2.\n2 Patients who died or used non-study antibacterial therapy or had missing measurements were classified as non-responders.\n3 The 95% Confidence Interval (CI) is computed using the Miettinen and Nurminen approach, stratified by baseline fever status.\nA key secondary endpoint in these two ABSSSI trials evaluated the percentage of ITT patients achieving a 20% or greater reduction in lesion area from baseline at 48-72 hours after initiation of therapy. Table 6 summarizes the findings for this endpoint in these two ABSSSI trials.\n1 There were 7 patients (as described in Table 5) who did not receive treatment and were counted as non-responders.\n3 The 95% CI is computed using the Miettinen and Nurminen approach, stratified by baseline fever status.\nAnother secondary endpoint in these two ABSSSI trials was the clinical success rate assessed at a follow-up visit occurring between Days 26 to 30. Clinical Success at this visit was defined as having a decrease in lesion size (both length and width measurements), a temperature of 37.6° C or lower, and meeting pre-specified criteria for local signs: purulent discharge and drainage absent or mild and improved from baseline, heat/warmth & fluctuance absent, swelling/induration & tenderness to palpation absent or mild.\nTable 7 summarizes clinical success rates at a follow-up visit for the ITT and clinically evaluable population in these two ABSSSI trials. Note that there are insufficient historical data to establish the magnitude of drug effect for antibacterial drugs compared with placebo at the follow-up visits. Therefore, comparisons of Dalvance to vancomycin/linezolid based on clinical success rates at these visits cannot be utilized to establish non-inferiority.\n1 There were 7 patients (as described in Table 5) who did not receive treatment and were counted as failures in the analysis.\n2 Patients who died, used non-study antibacterial therapy, or had an unplanned surgical intervention 72 hours after the start of therapy were classified as Clinical Failures.\nTable 8 shows outcomes in patients with an identified baseline pathogen, using pooled data from Trials 1 and 2 in the microbiological ITT (microITT) population. The outcomes shown in the table are clinical response rates at 48 to 72 hours and clinical success rates at follow-up (Day 26 to 30), as defined above.\nAll Dalvance dosing regimens in Trials 1 and 2 consisted of two doses.\n1 There were 2 patients in the Dalvance arm with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus at baseline who did not receive treatment and were counted as non-responders/failures.\n2 Early Responders are patients who had no increase from baseline in lesion area 48 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy, and had a temperature consistently at or below 37.6° C upon repeated measurement.\nAdult patients with ABSSSI were enrolled in a Phase 3, double-blind, clinical trial. The ITT population included 698 patients who were randomized to Dalvance treatment with either a single 1500 mg dose or a two-dose regimen of 1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg (Trial 3). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min had their dose adjusted (Section 2.2). Approximately 5% of patients also received a protocol-specified empiric course of treatment with intravenous aztreonam for coverage of Gram-negative pathogens. The specific infections and other patient characteristics in this trial were similar to those described above for previous ABSSSI trials.\nThe primary endpoint in this ABSSSI trial was the clinical response rate where responders were defined as patients who had at least a 20% decrease from baseline in lesion area 48 to 72 hours after randomization without receiving any rescue antibacterial therapy. The secondary endpoint was the clinical success rate at a follow-up visit occurring between Days 26 and 30, with clinical success defined as having at least a 90% decrease from baseline in lesion size, a temperature of 37.6° C or lower, and meeting pre-specified criteria for local signs: purulent discharge and drainage absent or mild and improved from baseline (for patients with wound infections), heat/warmth and fluctuance absent, swelling/induration and tenderness to palpation absent or mild. Table 9 summarizes results for these two endpoints in the ITT population. Note that there are insufficient historical data to establish the magnitude of drug effect for antibacterial drugs compared with placebo at the follow-up visit. Therefore, comparisons between treatment groups based on clinical success rates at this visitcannot be utilized to establish non-inferiority.\n1 There were 3 patients in the two-dose group who did not receive treatment and were counted as non-responders.\n3 The 95% Confidence Interval (CI) is computed using the Miettinen and Nurminen approach.\nTable 10 shows outcomes in patients with an identified baseline pathogen from Trial 3 in the microbiological ITT (microITT) population. The outcomes shown in the table are clinical response rates at 48 to 72 hours and clinical success rates at follow-up (Day 26 to 30), as defined above.\nIn Trials 1, 2, and 3, all patients had blood cultures obtained at baseline. A total of 40 ABSSSI patients who received Dalvance had bacteremia at baseline caused by one or more of the following bacteria: 26 S. aureus (21 MSSA and 5 MRSA), 6 S. agalactiae, 7 S. pyogenes, 2 S. anginosus group, and 1 E. faecalis. In patients who received Dalvance, a total of 34/40 (85%) were clinical responders at 48-72 hours and 32/40 (80%) were clinical successes at Day 26 to 30.\nUnreconstituted Dalvance (dalbavancin) for injection should be stored at 25ºC (77ºF); excursions permitted to 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].\nPatients should be advised that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur, and that serious allergic reactions require immediate treatment. Patients should inform their healthcare provider about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to Dalvance, or other glycopeptides.\nPatients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Dalvance should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Dalvance is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Dalvance and other antibacterial drugs in the future.\nPatients should be advised that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs and usually resolves when the drug is discontinued. Sometimes, frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection. If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, patients should contact their healthcare provider.\nDalvance® is a registered trademark of Durata Therapeutics Holding C.V., an Allergan affiliate.\n© 2018 Allergan.

    "text": "Will the No No Hair Removal System Work for you?\nWhen people see a new hair removal system that they have not tried, one of the first things they usually wonder is if the system will work for them. The No No Hair Removal system is one of these systems, as so many people use it and say it works for them.\nWill the No No Hair Removal system work for you, or will you be one of the few people that does not see results?\nWhat color is your hair? -- If you have darker hair that is coarse or thick, you will notice the No No Hair Removal system will work quickly for you. If you have lighter hair, it will take a little more time to work and, if you have blonde hair, it will not work at all. Be sure the type of hair you have is the hair that the manufacturer says the NoNo Hair Removal system works on before you buy it.\nCan you commit to daily use? -- Another reason for the No No Hair Removal system working or not working is the amount of commitment you are able to give to using the product.\nThis means it will generally work for you, just like it works for almost everyone else, if you are willing to commit to using it. That means, while you only have to use it for five to 10 minutes every day, you do have to use it every day for at least the first few weeks.\nLong-term use -- The people who say the No No Hair Removal system does not work are usually the ones that do not commit to using it. This is because you will need to use the No No Hair Removal system for several months if you want to get the results promised by the manufacturer."

    "text": "Most people are familiar with the sudden pain of a muscle cramp. The rapid, uncontrolled contraction, or spasm, happens unexpectedly, with either no stimulation or some trivially small one.\nThe muscle contraction and pain lasts for several minutes, and then slowly eases. Cramps may affect any muscle, but are most common in the calves, feet, and hands. While painful, they are harmless, and in most cases, not related to any underlying disorder. Nonetheless, cramps and spasms can be manifestations of many neurological or muscular diseases.\nThe terms cramp and spasm can be somewhat vague, and they are sometimes used to include types of abnormal muscle activity other than sudden painful contraction. These include stiffness at rest, slow muscle relaxation, and spontaneous contractions of a muscle at rest (fasciculation). Fasciculation is a type of painless muscle spasm, marked by rapid, uncoordinated contraction of many small muscle fibers. A critical part of diagnosis is to distinguish these different meanings and to allow the patient to describe the problem as precisely as possible.\nNormal voluntary muscle contraction begins when electrical signals are sent from the brain through the spinal cord along nerve cells called motor neurons (Nerve cells within the central nervous system that carry nerve impulses controlling muscle movement). These include both the upper motor neurons within the brain and the lower motor neurons (nerve cells within the central nervous system that carry nerve impulses controlling muscle movement) within the spinal cord and leading out to the muscle. At the muscle, chemicals released by the motor neuron stimulate the internal release of calcium ions from stores within the muscle cell. These calcium ions then interact with muscle proteins within the cell, causing the proteins (actin and myosin) to slide past one another. This motion pulls their fixed ends closer, thereby shortening the cell and, ultimately, the muscle itself. Recapture of calcium and unlinking of actin and myosin allows the muscle fiber to relax.\nAbnormal contraction may be caused by abnormal activity at any stage in this process. Certain mechanisms within the brain and the rest of the central nervous system help regulate contraction. Interruption of these mechanisms can cause spasm. Motor neurons that are overly sensitive may fire below their normal thresholds. The muscle membrane itself may be over sensitive, causing contraction without stimulation. Calcium ions may not be recaptured quickly enough, causing prolonged contraction.\nInteruption of brain mechanisms and overly sensitive motor neurons may result from damage to the nerve pathways. Possible causes include stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, neurodegenerative diseases, trauma, spinal cord injury, and nervous system poisons such as strychnine, tetanus, and certain insecticides. Nerve damage may lead to a prolonged or permanent muscle shortening called contracture.\nProlonged exercise: Curiously, relaxation of a muscle actually requires energy to be expended. The energy is used to recapture calcium and to unlink actin and myosin. Normally, sensations of pain and fatigue signal that it is time to rest. Ignoring or overriding those warning signals can lead to such severe energy depletion that the muscle cannot be relaxed, causing a cramp. The familiar advice about not swimming after a heavy meal, when blood flow is directed away from the muscles, is intended to avoid this type of cramp. Rigor mortis, the stiffness of a corpse within the first 24 hours after death, is also due to this phenomenon.\nDehydration and Salt Depletion: This may be brought on by protracted vomiting or diarrhea, or by copious sweating during prolonged exercise, especially in high temperatures. Loss of fluids and salts--especially sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium--can disrupt ion balances in both muscle and nerves. This can prevent them from responding and recovering normally, and can lead to cramp.\nMetabolic disorders that affect the energy supply in muscle. These are inherited diseases in which particular muscle enzymes are deficient. They include deficiencies of myophosphorylase (McArdle's disease), phosphorylase b kinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase.\nMyotonia: This causes stiffness due to delayed relaxation of the muscle, but does not cause the spontaneous contraction usually associated with cramps. However, many patients with myotonia do experience cramping from exercise. Symptoms of myotonia are often worse in the cold. Myotonias include myotonic dystrophy, myotonia congenita, paramyotonia congenita, and neuromyotonia.\nThe pain of a muscle cramp is intense, localized, and often debilitating Coming on quickly, it may last for minutes and fade gradually. Contractures develop more slowly, over days or weeks, and may be permanent if untreated. Fasciculations may occur at rest or after muscle contraction, and may last several minutes.\nMost cases of simple cramps require no treatment other than patience and stretching. Gently and gradually stretching and massaging the affected muscle may ease the pain and hasten recovery.\nMore prolonged or regular cramps may be treated with drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, or quinine. Fluid and salt replacement, either orally or intravenously, is used to treat dehydration. Treatment of underlying metabolic or neurologic disease, where possible, may help relieve symptoms.\nCramps may be treated or prevented with Gingko (Ginkgo biloba) or Japanese quince (Chaenomeles speciosa). Supplements of vitamin E, niacin, calcium, and magnesium may also help. Taken at bedtime, they may help to reduce the likelihood of night cramps.\nThe likelihood of developing cramps may be reduced by eating a healthy diet with appropriate levels of minerals, and getting regular exercise to build up energy reserves in muscle. Avoiding exercising in extreme heat helps prevent heat cramps. Heat cramps can also be avoided by taking salt tablets and water before prolonged exercise in extreme heat. Taking a warm bath before bedtime may increase circulation to the legs and reduce the incidence of night-time leg cramps."

    "text": "Despite several recent advances, Streptococcus pneumoniae is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among very young, elderly and immunocompromised individuals all over the world. Pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA) is a multifunctional lipoprotein present on all known serotypes of S. pneumoniae and is significantly involved in bacterial adherence and virulence. Mutations in PsaA reduce growth, virulence, and adherence of pathogen. Moreover, this protein inhibits complements activation, binds lactoferrin, and elicits protective systemic immunity against pneumococcal infection. Identification of PsaA peptides that optimally bind human leukocyte antigen (HLA) would greatly contribute to global vaccine efforts, but this is hindered by the multitude of HLA polymorphisms. We used an experimental data set of 28 PsaA synthetic peptides and in silico methods to predict peptide binding to HLA and murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. We also characterized spleen- and cervical lymph node (CLN)-derived helper T lymphocyte cytokine responses to these peptides after S. pneumoniae strain EF3030-challenge in mice. Individual, yet overlapping peptides, 15 amino acids in length revealed residues 231 to 268 of PsaA consistently caused the highest IFN- γ , IL-2, IL-5, IL-17 responses and proliferation as well as moderate IL-10 and IL-4 responses by ex vivo stimulated splenic and CLN CD4 + T cells isolated from S. pneumoniae strain EF3030-challenged F 1 (B6 x BALB/c) mice. IEDB, RANKPEP, SVMHC, MHCPred, and SYFPEITHI in silico analysis tools revealed that peptides PsaA231-268 also interact with a broad range of HLA-DP, -DQ, and -DR alleles. These data suggest that predicted MHC class II-peptide binding affinities not only correlate with T helper (Th) cytokine and proliferative responses to PsaA peptides, but when used together with in vivo validation can be a useful tool to choose candidate pneumococcal HTL epitopes."

Should getting a US passport renewal be on your to-do list this fall? Possibly-check the expiration date, and keep in mind that the US Department of State recommends applying for a US passport renewal 9 months before your current passport expires.\nAll of Europe is on holiday in the summer, it seems-which makes the fall a particularly nice time to visit. Say “Ciao!” to long lines, crowds and stifling heat, and enjoy a quieter, more relaxed European vacation.\nWith world-class ski facilities like Whistler in British Columbia, Canada is an excellent place to hit the powder this fall and winter. Ski season in Canada generally begins in November and ends in April, so if you’re planning to go this year, now is an excellent time to apply for that US passport renewal. Under the WHTI, passports are required for US citizens flying into/out of Canada. When driving into/out of Canada, you need a passport, a passport card, an enhanced driver’s license, or another form of WHTI-compliant ID like a NEXUS, SENTRI or FAST card.\nIf you can’t bear to let go of that summer sunshine just yet, why not follow it? After all, September may mark the beginning of fall in the US, but great beach weather can still be found in the Caribbean, South America, or even further afield, in Thailand or Australia.\nAre you dreading the upcoming hustle and bustle of the holiday season? Sometimes, the best way to appreciate the holidays is to experience them somewhere else. Whether you just want to see the way another culture celebrates the holidays or you’d prefer to go all Ebenezer Scrooge and avoid them entirely, apply for a US passport renewal now and you’ll be all set!"

    "text": "If your website is not fast enough, people who are visiting it will feel and act in the exact same way that you and I would.\nMeaning, there will be a dose of irritation, which will convert in impatience. Those emotions will evoke action. Namely – bounce. Except in the cases where you really, really want or need to enter a website, you will most probably bounce, if it doesn’t load in, say, 4-5 seconds.\nThere are studies that show all this is caused by the high-speed internet and the way that all of our modern technologies work. Which, in essence, are reinforcing the craving of instant gratification, that all of us have.\nBut wait, there is more! The loading speed of your website is also crucial for your SEO. The search engines are trying to give their customers the best experience, so they are striving to put the most relevant and faster-loading website on the higher positions of their result pages.\nYou already know that you have to take care of the loading speed of your WordPress website, so let’s not waste time and dive into the WordPress Performance Optimization.\nThere are a lot of reasons to use WordPress Hosting. And if you are about to create a website on WordPress probably the best thing you can do is to do so using WordPress Hosting. Doing so will optimize the performance of your WordPress website.\nStart your blog in less than 20 minutes!\nWhen you visit a website, your browser (most of them) is caching the content you see. Meaning, it temporary stores web documents like HTML pages and image. This information technology is used in order for the server lag to be reduced.\nYet, WordPress’ pages are dynamically built every time someone visits your website. That results in a bit of lag because the CMS has to request from the database the information need for the page to be constructed and displayed.\nTo overcome this lag, you’ll need to install a plugin. And as probably all of the features that you can add to your WordPress, there are a vast number of plugins that you can use.\nMy personal preferences are leading me towards WP Super Cache. Mainly because it’s easy to set it up and yet, the result is noticeable.\nKeeping your WordPress updated is as much important for the security of your site, as it is for its performance. By keeping up to date you’ll get all the new features of the CMS but will also make it reliable and faster.\nOf course, not all updates are making your website faster, but every once in a while an update will address that, and your website should be updated when that happens. This is one more thing you can do to optimize your WordPress performance.\nImages are really important part of your content and the overall look and feel of a website. But if they are not optimized for web, you’ll have a hard time retaining visitors on your website.\nImages have two main metrics to be observed. Size of resolution and size of the file. An image, if optimized, can have nearly the same resolution as its original but the file size could be shrunk enormously.\nThis is an important step because no matter how big an image is, in sense of resolution, if it is not optimized, in sense of file size, it could delay the delivery of your content to the visitors. And we all know, delivery delay is always annoying.\nThere are a lot of ways of optimizing images. One of which is, of course, Photoshop. I would recommend you to use. JPEG file format. But if you are not familiar with Photoshop, you can use other tools. Some of them are free and a lot simpler than Photoshop.\nWhen you are creating posts or pages, and you are constantly updating (and saving) your work, all the revisions are saved in the database of your website.\nAs you can guess, all these revisions of your content are taking up space and loading time, so you will be better off without them.\nThere are, of course, plugins that can and will take care of all those revisions, but you can simply add a line of code into your wp-config.php file and achieve the exact same result. Plus, you won’t install a plugin.

    "text": "A once-in-a-decade upgrade to our wireless systems is coming this year.\nThe technology world is already abuzz with excitement about the transition to 5G in 2019.\nBut those of you who might not be as tech-obsessed may have some questions about what 5G is and why it’s such a big deal.\nWe break it down for you in this week’s Tech on Tuesday.\nFifth-generation cellular networks, or 5G for short, is a set of technical ground rules which define the workings of a cellular network. This includes the radio frequency used and how things like computer chips and antennas handle radio signals and exchange data.\nEngineers from various companies have been meeting to agree on new specifications for cell networks since the first cellphones were demonstrated in the 1970s.\nBut it doesn’t just affect your smartphones. Other devices like industrial robots, security cameras, drones and cars that send traffic data to one another will all see the impact of 5G.\nIt’s safe to say 5G will be noticeably faster than our current 4G, but just how fast will that be?\nQualcomm, the wireless chip maker, told the New York Times it had shown peak 5G download speeds of 4.5 gigabits, but expect initial median speeds of about 1.4 gigabits. That is about 20 times faster than the current 4G experience.\nUsers will especially notice the 5G speeds in higher-quality streaming video.\nQualcomm says downloading a standard movie at the median speed will take 17 seconds with 5G, as opposed to six minutes to download for 4G.\nWhen will we see 5G in the U.S.?\nWhile the precise timing is unclear, smartphone users in the United States should see 5G by the second quarter of 2019.\nAT&T has already switched on mobile 5G service in 12 cities, but right now smartphones aren’t ready for a direct connection to 5G networks. Until then, AT&T will market a 5G hot-spot device to funnel wireless broadband connections to nearby phones and computers.\nRight now, the first Samsung smartphones for AT&T’s 5G network is expected to be available in the first half of this year. Apple users may have to wait a little longer, as analysts predict iPhones with 5G capabilities won’t arrive until 2020."

Please, enjoy!\nGabriel Filip began his journey in music from a young age in Romania where he always had an interest drawn towards electronic music. This was due to the influence he aspired from his social surroundings and friends, who at the time were involved in this particular style. At the age of 14 his inspiration was sparked after visiting a friend who was also involved in electronic music and had developed his skill to be able to show Gabriel various programs, techniques and styles directed on the working process of developing this style of music through various softwares. A year after being involved in this working process, he then decided to form a band in the city with another two members and named the group ‘Electric sound’.\nAfter a valuable time in broadening his knowledge in all areas of part-taking in an electronic band, the group decided to go there separate ways and follow their individuality. Although this was a slight turning point, he never lost his passion for music and continued to pursue his passion and practice his skills in producing music and always maintained positive feedback from the tracks he produced.\nIn 2010 Gabriel officially moved to Cyprus after a five year time period of visiting the country, where he met Aristos Vattis at Limassol Marina’s roof bar who was a DJ/Producer playing at the time, who is also the founder of Airland music. After discussions on their mutual, common shared interest, Gabriel joined the team and was given the opportunity to show his talents.\nHis style has developed to be a combination of deep house/dark chill-out. His first tracks were released in collaboration with Airland music studios in 2017."

    "text": "iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus: Which should I upgrade to?\nBefore finally seeing Apple making its foray into the phablet market I had been waiting for a number of years now. One of the greatest innovator of our time, Steve Jobs, once famously stated the iPhone size that was original was the ideal form factor. A cellphone with screen size smaller in relation to the iPhone was said to not be good. Anything will be big.\nFor many years now, Apple’s close rivals have been releasing larger screen smartphones and the strategy seems to be going very well with smartphone users. I thought it was the final opportunity that I’m giving to Apple this year. If they’re not releasing a bigger iPhone, I was all set to produce a switch away from the iPhone. For quite a while now, I ‘d been excited to get the Galaxy Note 3 but it was because of my despise for Samsung that I ‘d not been making the switch.\nNow the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus had been formally unveiled, it leaves me in a situation that is difficult to make my pick. I know there are millions of people out there who’d similar predicament as me. The massive size of the iPhone 6 Plus is definitely an appealing factor. But not long after it was made available, there had been tonnes of reviews and reports that uncover a possible design flaw with the iPhone 6 Plus. Referred to some as the ‘bendgate’ scandal, when you place it in your back pocket iPHone 6 Plus had been reported to be bendable.\nIt has been several years now since I’ve been needing to upgrade from my iPhone 4. All the hypes and dilemmas leave me in doubt if it’s the very best time to get the iPhone 6 Plus now or is it better to go with the smaller iPhone 6 instead. Is the screen size of the iPhone 6 large enough. I am thinking if I’ll regret my decision for getting the smaller screen. It makes me wonder whether the screen size is all there is that we have to consider when picking between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. I’m really not sure. I’m still looking for that someone to enlighten me on this issue.\nPutting on a hat can tell a good deal regarding a person. The hat is able to unveil the wearer’s occupation, the style quotient of the individual, or perhaps the hat may be worn to protect you from the bright sun light. Hats were once an important part of a woman or man’s wardrobe and, although those days have passed, hats are actually seeing a small come back in the fashion world.\nThere’s a wide selection of hats for women and men available in the market plus both may select in accordance with their preference. They are able to choose hats produced from different types of materials like wool or felt or straw or cotton or canvas. Coming from a dapper fedora to a lady’s pill box hat, you can find one to match any situation. There are actually occasions in which it is popular to wear hats that are stylish or outlandish. One such popular event where hats take up an important role for the fashion conscious is the Kentucky Derby. It is somewhat like a custom to wear hats during the derby season and individuals that keep to the traditions are pretty serious, while on the other hand few individuals seize the chance to experiment with the design by wearing hats which are produced from fake flowers, feathers, fruits or other one of a kind designs.\nWhenever you might be selecting a hat to get, you ought to usually try it on, not only for size, but to see how well it goes along with the shape of your face as well as your complexion. You need to choose a hat that is of bold color as it goes well with the color of your hair and skin. By no means pick a round hat if you possess a round face. It will make your face seem to be shorter and plumper.\nSun hats having wide brims are available in many different designs and colors for spring and summer. There usually are styles which tend to be designed to end up being worn at the pool together with your swimming costume or even some wide brim hats tend to be best to put on with a sundress whenever you decide to go out to lunch with close friends. Wide brim hats are also extremely practical.\nMoreover hats safeguard your neck and face area along with head from becoming tanned when you are gardening or are simply lying on the seaside. The brim functions as a shield and in addition to protecting from the sun rays also helps to keep you much cooler. The majority of brimmed hats tend to be designed to offer shade, however for highest protection, you need to select those that have a larger brim.\nAn additional thing to consider is the material that the hat is made. Whether they happen to be idling in your closet or perhaps on a coat tree, hats accumulate airborne dirt and dust and if you purchase hats made from fabrics like wool, suede or felt, you might need to have them cleaned professionally. Straw can be very easily cleaned and you may be able to toss a cotton or canvas cap directly into the washer to be cleaned. Hats for men and women can be a very exciting accessory and you need not be very serious about selection of any one of them.\nIt is a gloomy day to most of us who have come to know this man through his adrenaline-pumping books and novels. The passing of Tom Clancy marks a loss to guys like yourself and myslef who have been exposed to (and grown old) with his intriguing espionage stories and close to real-life art of works.\nI am writing this piece as a mini tribute to one of the biggest writer that I have known to have ever lived.\nI have read every single book authored by Tom Clancy. My ultimate favorite is ‘Red Storm Rising’. I’m sure every one of you has your own favorite, so just feel free to share yours in the comments below.\nThe discussion about Casio G-Shock watches is virtually equivalent to the discussion about tough watches. A decade has passed since its first production but no other watch could replace G-Shock from the career of king of tough watches. However, there also a number of tougher watches than Casio G-shock Brand which you can easily reach. It is only that neither of the alternative watch makers has their focus solely on making the world’s most solid watches. You’ll be surprised that even in markets like military uses, there are a number of choices available.\nThe timekeeping procedure is followed all around the world and so there are endless uses of watch. You can also see the apparel style or dress code which is appropriate to your own watch may be distinct from now and again. Watches for armed forces should be created with some consideration about the uniform’s shade. Here is the chief reason for which watches G-Shock military inspired series are of the colors like like grey, olive green, navy blue. Some watches that are specially designed to wear along with glamorous gown should have some sparkle color, for example silver and gold.\nWhere to purchase your demanding watch is dependent on your own taste. I know some people still love going to their local watch store to buy their watches. If you are the sort of shopper who needs to physically touch and see an item prior to buying, then online shopping may not be your cup of tea. The reason for which I want to buy my tough watches online is the reality that I get to do plenty of research work through the reviews of other users prior to buying. In addition, with hundreds of online stores at your disposal, I normally have a higher possibility of finding small versions such as G-Shock military inspired series online.\nIt is important consider the several things before deciding to buy a tough watch. The most crucial considerations are watch movement and the strap material. There are few different materials that are usually used to make the strap of tough watches.\nTitanium and stainless steel are popular watch materials; although they enrich the look of tough watches they are not the best for the military niche. That is why most G-Shock military inspired series use resin sort of material that can take on different camouflage colors.\nThe watch movement is very important because poor quality movement will not last particularly during a fall. It is necessary to read rough watches review before making a choice of purchase. It is impossible to get the toughest watches if you do not read and compare the watches available in the market.\nFinding the finest watch that will match your character can be difficult for you, particularly should you not know how exactly to do it. It is vital to go through the critiques of tough watches so you have access to the widest change of accessible tough watches. Make sure you are clear about your own personal demand so that you understand what issues to look out for. G-Shock group should be the first name that occurs for most buyers looking for the toughest watches in the world. In case that you don’t like the look of Casio G-shock, then there are other options available from different manufacturers. But do not equate military watches as the toughest watches since they’re not. As a last note, a tough watch will last you for a long time so do not attempt to skimp on this one.\nShould there be one thing that unites the various cultures and cuisines together, it’ll be coffee. Today, Coffee remains the world’s most loved drink. This is regardless of numerous efforts to highlight the disadvantage of caffeine which have been conducted through various types of studies.\nYou are able to go to common sites like Mc Cafe and grab a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Despite the popularity of such institutions, I was astonished to learn that when given a choice, most coffee drinkers prefer to brew their own cup of coffee.\nHousehold appliance makers are quick to identify this growing market segment which explains why we’re seeing a wide variety of form of coffee makers in the market. As consumers, we may genuinely believe that more options always mean better. On the contrary, the task of finding the Best Coffee Maker is made difficult as a result of the aggressive marketing campaign used by the many manufacturers. That is why getting hold of good coffee maker reviews is essential.\nWhenever you are buying a coffee maker, there are many factors to consider. While capacity of your coffeemaker is essential, don’t forget about other factors including the ease of maintenance and price. Selecting the most appropriate capacity that fits to your need is very important because of few reasons. If you are brewing for group consumption, the best coffee maker for your case is those with larger capacity such as 4-cups coffee makers instead of single serve coffee makers that are more suitable for individual consumption. The brewing time taken by a single serve coffee maker is faster than the time required by a 4-cups coffee maker. Furthermore, expect smaller water tank capacity when you are buying single serve coffee makers. The size range of most coffee glasses is between 4 to 8oz. It is logical for 4-cup coffee makers to take on greater dimension. Understanding the maintenance effort required out of the coffeemaker that you are purchasing can be important. Some coffee machines have rinse functionality. Using the press of a button, this feature allows you to clean the filter after each use. Your coffeemaker budget might range between less than $100 to more than $1000, depending on the features and brands that you are buying. Rich set of features are found in higher priced coffee machine models but only few of them are really useful. For that reason, to avoid investing in features which is of little use to you, it’s very important to carefully examine the usefulness of each feature.\nHaving an excellent espresso machine and highest quality coffee beans are not the only part of the equation to making great brew of coffee. A espresso maker may be excellent but unless you learn how to use it, you will not gain the most from it. The exact same can be said of premium quality beans. If you bought a pack of coffee bean, whether it’s from Dunkin Donuts or Green Mountain, it’s very important to understand what level of coarseness is the bean best suited for. Certain beans are suitable for more coarser setting while some are ideal for finer grinding. You will then have to check if the espresso machine that you have can make great coffee with all the coarseness of your pounded beans. Just then, you’ll have the whole ingredients into making a perfect coffee.\nEspresso as a drink, will continue to attract new followers and caffeine use will remain a controversial issue. There’s nothing more satisfying than being able to brew your own cup of coffee even when this means you’ve to put in more effort. To obtain the most out of your coffees, you have to grind them right before brewing and that is why having coffee grinder at home is essential. Cost isn’t the single factor in determining the best coffee maker but good quality coffee makers don’t come cheap so that you have to be really careful in selecting one.\nThe greatest sound solution for your living-room at present is definitely a sound bar. Sound bars are now produced by a great number of electronics and sound companies. The end result is that We now have numerous sound bars to choose from, to test, and naturally have fun with. Because there are a great number of sound bars, sound bar reviews grow to be vital when reaching conclusion to buy one. Lately, sound bars have displaced home theater in the box as the utmost prominent music solution in the family area. I am not disappointed considering that sound bars pack quite a value for this cost and the simpleness.\nThe greatest advantage of a sound bar is definitely it’s simpleness. A sound bar is very easy to put together, but it really produces superior quality audio reproduction. Thanks to sound bars, you don’t need to setup the rear speakers, hence it’s simpleness and cost reduction to achieve a surround setup. Without having rear speakers, sound bars make it easy for perhaps even beginner audio enthusiast to achieve fantastic surround installation without the need of help. Without rear speakers, sound bars permit straightforward living-room installation: no more back audio speakers wiring together. Sound bars eliminate all these problems linked to the home entertainment solution setup at your home. Today everyone can have a good surround installation without having to pay out big cash.\nWhen one buys a brand new sound bar, there are several factors to consider. Acoustic quality is the most important consideration accompanied by product suitability and price tag. Since acoustic quality is very important, you have to select the manufacturer that uses superior quality parts and implements the most effective algorithms. To begin with, you should browse the sound bar reviews available in online. If you do not go though proper soundbar reviews and evaluations, choosing the right type would have been a struggle. System suitability is by today mostly settled by the manufacturers. Nonetheless, checking the fittings that you require continues to be necessary. The less costly sound bars might not support a lot of digital connections. Your sound bar purchase can cost you between $100 to $600, based on your requirements. Please check your allowance prior to making your decision.\nSometimes you can purchase sound bars for a substantially lower price tag. You may buy sound bars for slight price cut during Cyber Monday and Christmas period. But the brands often drop the price for the duration of February to May period as these would be the so-called slow-moving calendar months. You could watch for discounts, however, I will locate discount rates all the time online. Cyber Monday and Christmas would be the time for everybody to purchase gift items meant for others. There is absolutely no best time to purchase a little something for your own. Therefore generally Allow me to shop around to get the best price tag in certain time period. Amazon’s price are generally very good, especially throughout price cut time frame. You should set your allowance as you can blow big cash getting sound bar. Last but not least We highly recommend for you to research for sound bar reviews when you are deciding.\nYou can buy a great sound bar provided that you keep to a reputable company. You should search for the perfect acoustic quality according to your allowance. The majority of the cutting edge sound bar versions produce great acoustic quality. Stay with quality brands, and you will definitely do good. Don’t get sound bars from less reputable company even though they are extremely economical. Sound bars not coming from respectable manufacturers, in my opinion, generate lower sound quality. Sound bars are also thought to be attractive family area equipment, therefore try to get complimenting designs with the tv and wall color. You can actually enjoy your sound bar as both the quality audio equipment and as the visible adornment for your living room area. Sound bar reviews are important as there are many brands out there manufacturing sound bars.\nChristmas is the day when all Christians commemorate the birth of Jesus. Nowadays, X’mas has turned into a virtually universal festivity celebrated by millions of people from all walks of life – Christians and non-Christians. The reality that X’mas falls just few days prior to the current year is coming to a finish helps promote the fun and holiday spirits. In the end, it’s a rather good reason to have sometime off from the usual busy days. If there is one single thing that makes every Christmas so different from the rest of the celebrated occasion, it has to be the amazing decorations and lights that people in various corners of the planet has developed. There are an incredible number of ideas around this time of the season and here are some great ideas which will help you this time round.\nWhen discussing elegant Christmas decorations, you’ve got to distinguish between outdoor vs indoor. Ideally, everybody loves to see both inside and outside of the house to be beautified for the holidays. Frequently, the lack of time and budget stop homeowners from achieving this. The theme and decorations necessary for indoor and outdoor Christmas decorations are totally different. For one, with indoor ornaments you’ll not have to worry about the weather, as opposed to outside ornaments where you must consider whether it’s sturdy enough to withstand chilling temperature, rays of the sun or snow. Shining decorations for indoor can help liven the mood of the dwelling in it. On another hand, decoratives designed to be put on the yard are usually pre-lit so they are visible during the night.\nHave you ever pondered why sometimes when you visit friends and relatives during the holiday season, you’ve good feeling when entering some houses but not the remainder? I come to understand that what separates elegant Christmas decorations from typical ones has got to do with the theme that is used. The choices and combinations of color, shape and decorative variety have to be blended as one theme. Through the years, we can see enhancement in terms of creativity from house owners in regards to Christmas decoration theme. Rustic Christmas decoration is well-liked by those who are obsessed with something oldies. Recently, the geeks came up with their very own geeky subjects. One of these is a Xmas tree that has been dressed up using icons taken from today’s popular social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.\nOf all the corners of the home, outside is where things will get really enjoyable and exciting to even both adults and kids likewise. Before beginning, remember to set your-self a budget though. Decoration manufacturers have been wonderful in regards to creativity and I can let you know how frequent I have been left ga-ga with all the decoration offering that just blow my imagination away. If budget isn’t an issue, you are able to change your garden to the land of magic that is full of assorted hues lighting populated with popular Christmas figurines. Inflatable characters from Disney are popular among kiddies, particularly one where Donald gets himself dressed up in Santa costume.\nXmas decoration can be described as a exciting thing though to produce elegant Christmas decoration, it is not at all something that everyone can be guaranteed of, especially if no planning is involved since the beginning. If you’re a handicraft lover, you would not want to get your ornaments from the store no matter how convenience it may be. Christmas wreaths are some of the many decors which you could do yourself, and you can hold up to you want in various places in your property. Finally, make sure to set a budget and stick to it closely should you not want to end up footing huge credit card debt immediately after the holidays.\nThe raging debate on the importance of air purifiers has been on-going for a relatively long time. Just like the nature of air that people breathe in every second where it is always there but it is always not visible to us. Until we’ve an apparatus that measures the quality of the air, it’s nearly impossible for ordinary people like you and me, to distinguish the air quality before and after having a purifier is dispatched. For that reason, in shopping for the best air purifier, we have to rely a lot on the air purifier ratings reviews written by real users who’ve experienced significant benefit of using an air purifier.\nFundamentally, there are only but two main types of air purifiers on the market today; always make certain that you use this directive as you read air purifier reviews. The initial category is filter-based and the second category is ionizer-based. Obviously, filter-based purifier is the older technology among both but by simply looking at the increasing quantity of ionic air purifier reviews, you can tell how popular ionizer-based air purifier among consumers. Regarding which of the two is more superior than the other, my take is it is dependent upon what you expect from the air purifier. It’s important to note that when you eventually buy filter-based air purifiers you’ll have to frequently change or replace filters. Ionizer-based models don’t require regular replacement however the plate used to attract the dust needs to be cleaned regularly if you’d like your unit to work effectively.\nThe first important step that you’ve to-do when trying to find an air purifier is to consider the reason you need one. This will avert circumstances where you make an assessment of the air purifies but basing on a wrong assessment process. For example, if you are a pet owner and pet hairs is the priority, you would then have to be looking out for the best air purifier for pets. If you’re experiencing Asthma and have been recommended by your physician to obtain an air purifier, then you need the best air purifier for asthma patients. The basic fundamental on what air cleanser works remain the same however it is the component specifications which make the difference. For that reason, if you’re clear concerning this right from the start, you may save a great deal of time.\nIt’s proposed to have a clear-cut objective about what you really should make your best air purifier ratings reviews research easier. When you know what you need and what you do not, you can make reference to the list of best air purifiers for 2013 and simply see which types accomplish your requirements checklist. This is the recommended approach to jump start your air purifier hunt as it will save you both time and money. Once you’re able to narrow down your option, you should also be sure that you purchase the latest design because you are perhaps not able to purchase the older models from the industry when these old models are sold out.\nThe festive mood should be here sooner than we have thought. I understand this isn’t the very best economic time we are at, but I think we all would still be forking out a tiny sum presenting gifts to your loved ones.\nI have to state that I’m fortunate enough to be able to afford few gifts, at the least to those that are most significant in my life.\nThat was the easy part. Now, the hard part is, in case you have to decide on a present to your nearest and dearest, what shall it be?\nI know the selections are unlimited but here are 3 items which top my list this year.\nFrom the beginning of time, the use of backpack had always been widespread and it is one that is used irrespective of race and civilization. Given the numerous uses of backpacks in several aspects of our life, it is a fact that’s not astonishing at all. If you’re say somebody with obsession for traveling and used to doing it on your own (free-and-easy), you know how a great backpack can conveniently store all type of belongings, from clothing’s to equipment’s to invaluable. If you’re attending school, you know the value of having an excellent backpack as you use it to transport all of the large textbooks and in these days, laptops. Backpacks aren’t limited by these use cases and fashion lovers have made use of backpack as a form of beautiful vogue accessories.\nOne crucial thing to do if you want to purchase a new backpack is to to define the precise reasons that your backpack is going to be employed for. Your shopping – whether it is for the best backpacks for college or others – is going to be a good deal easier if that is obvious to you since the beginning. I am saying this simply because backpack is a general term and you can find so many backpack manufacturers to choose from, with each likely to have its own market dominance in specific needs or niches. And so the next time you are looking for the strongest hiking backpacks, you have to consider brands like Stansport as opposed to Jansport. This implies that you can straight away zoom in your selections and target only those ranges that you will probably end up buying anyway.\nOf course buying a backpack is as simple as stepping into a store, just grab one that is most gorgeous looking and make your payment. There is nothing wrong with this process but you have to understand that it’d take at the minimum several iterations before you find yourself with one that you’ll ultimately use for at least the following few years. If you prefer to boost the chances of choosing the best backpacks for your specific purposes, then it is very important to go through backpack buying guides. A great backpack opinion piece must discuss at the minimum few fundamental features including the level of comfort (pressure that the bag is putting to your back), durability, internal designs and few options that fall within similar price band.\nOne big section of the backpack industry is the university students. Remember this market segment often lumps both high school and college together though. Throughout my study years, I still recall clearly that I had a need to carry many large books and very often, these were significantly more than what my backpack could cater to. How time passes and the huge wave of adoption of mobile computing (with tablets and slimmer laptops) is really disrupting the classroom teaching paradigm. One of the change is actually towards e-textbooks in place of hard printed books. On initial thought, it seems that lighter backpack would be the natural result as it’s no longer required to carry these weighty textbooks to school. Things didn’t turn out as what many students would have wished for. While e-book carries no weight, laptop is almost compulsory for every single university student and 17-inch laptop, that is becoming popular these days, might weigh up to 2kg. How everybody else wish that all notebooks will be as slim and as weightless as the Macbook Air but its price is still beyond the reach of many college students.\nAdventure fans make up a important market segment of the general backpack market. The word outdoor is very universal and it encompasses such niches as professional mountain climbing to camp fire to light trekking. I am aware the first brand which will appear to most people’s thought when discussing backpack would be Jansport. While it’s certainly one of the fine manufacturer, it’s good to keep in mind that they are known in large part due to their college backpack rather than adventure. In this regard, Teton will be the name that a lot of outdoor enthusiasts will be going for. Be warned however that the best outdoor backpacks, say a backpack that is best for mountain climbing,, won’t be one that comes with the best physical appearance.\nBased on these facts alone, I believe backpack is something which will always maintain its relevancy. But despite this, I am confident to say that that changes (in terms of dimension, design and style) will continuously take place. Are we going to see the size of student and professional backpacks shrinking later on?It is because the answer is dependent upon the size that future computing devices will need. When the talk of collapsible (or bendable display) becomes a reality, the size of notebooks may shrink to half or maybe a quarter of its current dimension. When this becomes a reality, it’s time for backpack manufacturers to start producing smaller backpacks."

    "text": "How Does DNA Do It?\nLast time we left you with the mother of all molecular cliffhangers: how can it be that the simple four-letter code of DNA can carry the information to make all life? Early in that piece we’d thrown in the fact that the human genome (i.e. our DNA) is made up of three billion letters. As Watson and Crick showed 53 years ago, it’s actually two intertwined molecules, each with three thousand million letters – but it’s the number that’s important because that carries all that’s needed to make you and me.\nBut, if you’re like me, you have real problems grasping the meaning of numbers much above 100 – so that ‘millions’, yet alone ‘billions’, come across simply as ‘lots’– and we’re left shaking in our head in bewilderment as to how it works.\nTo get some sort of a grip on the scale of information that genomes can carry, it might be helpful to look at DNA from the other end, so to speak. This approach started five years ago among a group who work on applying computer technology to handling biological data – i.e. how to acquire, store, analyse and interpret the tsunami of genetic information now being produced. It’s a new field called bioinformatics.\nWhat set the bioinformatics bods thinking is a point that will have occurred to you as an internet user (and who isn’t?). How can we deal with the unimaginable amount of info we want to store? That includes everything from your holiday snaps to the tons of scientific data, including the continuing flood of genomics. If ‘millions’ leaves you boggling, how about the estimate for the global digital archive of 44 trillion gigabytes by 2020 (I think that’s 44 followed by 21 zeros). That’s a 10-fold increase from 2013.\nWhatever the numbers are, they’re unimaginable but, aside from being boggled by the facts, a slight problem is that storing that amount on conventional memory sticks would use at least 10 times the amount of available silicon. So, as they say, we have a problem.\nUse trit code to make DNA (0, 1 or 2 translated into a base, A,T,G or C, that differs from the one just used.\nOne of the first experiments encoded Shakespeare’s sonnets in DNA, which showed that the idea was feasible – what scientists call a ‘proof of principle’. Of course, that’s only a beginning. There are big problems to overcome, like being able to make DNA strands cheaply and quickly enough and to be able to access the data required with the ease we’re used to with hard drives and flash memories. On the flip side, DNA preserved in permafrost has been sequenced from woolly mammoths tens of thousands of years old and from horses entombed for 700,000 years, so we know that as a storage medium it’s rather more durable than anything currently in use.\nThe key point here is that, at the moment, DNA appears to be the only option if we are not to grind to a halt on the information storage front. Regardless of solving the problems involved, that alone gives a new perspective to the coding power of those four little bases, A, C, G and T.\nExtance, A. (2016). How DNA could store all the world’s data. Nature 537, 22–24.\nGoldman, N. et al. (2013). Nature 494, 77-80.\nOrlando, L. et al. (2013). Nature 499, 74-78."

    "text": "Let’s focus on how can you optimize your website, and to do so, we’ll hear from the specialist who created e-commerce software to run an online store, Oferer.com.\nWhy is a high ranking position in Google so important?\nIf your online store and your products are visible on Google, this will bring more traffic to your website. It will also positively affect profits. Don’t forget that a majority of customers look for products on Google by using the appropriate keywords. And here’s how to have your site found for those keywords.\nWe will start with the optimization of the entire store for SEO. Make sure that the online domain matches the name of your store. Therefore, when you choose the name of your company, check whether the domain is available. In addition, the domain of the online store should be simple, so that the customers can easily remember it and could enter it in the search engine. Domains with the ending “.com” are the best.\nUnique product descriptions are very important. Remember not to copy descriptions from other websites! A common mistake among online stores owners is copying descriptions from suppliers. This phenomenon results in what Google calls Duplicate Content and has a negative impact on positioning.\nTherefore, stand out from the competition and optimize your store! Write in a simple and understandable language. Speak the language of benefits and indicate why the customer should purchase your item. In addition, divide the description into several parts. Indicate the general aspects of the product and create more detailed information about the stock or collection. Finally, enter the technical specification of the product such as parameters.\nThe last tip is the implementation of keywords. As mentioned above, the keyword itself can be the domain of the online store. It is important that the title of the item includes its name, model, additional parameters, e.g. color. In the detailed information, also include keywords – preferably in the intensity of 3% to 7%- when it’s more you can get the opposite effect.\nThe store’s optimization is very important and positively affect your profit."

    "text": "Using German archival records and letters and diaries of both civilians and soldiers during WWII, The German War – A Nation Under Arms, 1939–1945 by Nicholas Stargardt is a fascinating book that illustrates the strong civilian support for Germany’s armed forces right up until the end of the war. At the same time, the book shows how the ordinary German (civilian and soldier) rationalized atrocity and genocide as necessary for the good of the nation.\nFor a several decades after WWII, the myth of “good” Germans vs. the “evil” Nazis was maintained in post-war Germany. It wasn’t until the mid-1960s that the next generation began seriously questioning their parents about their role in the war. Finally, at the turn of the 21st century, a traveling German exhibition regarding the role of ordinary soldier (Wehrmachtsausstellung) showed beyond doubt the culpability of the ordinary soldier (not just the SS) in atrocity and genocide.\nIn 1985 the German President Richard von Weizsäcker delivered a speech to the Bundestag acknowledging WWII Germany’s evil deeds and proclaiming May 8, 1945 as the day of Germany’s liberation from despotism rather than surrender and occupation. Subsequently, reluctance to examine the facts about the Third Reich faded and critical inquiry expanded.\nIn my view, Japan has yet to come to similar realization regarding the terrible atrocities committed by its armed forces on enemies and civilian populations all over Asia. (Part of this fact may have paradoxically been due to the fact that much of Imperial Japanese history was skipped over in new textbooks during the reconstruction of the Japanese educational system by America educators after the war).\nIt was true that Western imperialism had abused and hobbled many Asian countries before the war. And certainly the decision to firebomb most Japanese cities in 1945 and ultimately drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki left powerful moral questions about targeting civilians in wartime.\nBut Imperial Japan’s assertion that it was acting as a “big brother” to lead Western-colonized nations into the light of freedom was patently disingenuous. Imperial Japanese occupation of Asian countries was uncommonly cruel and rapacious."

    "text": "In order to assess the extent to which tidal stream environments are exploited by a range of seabird species a series of boat-based surveys were carried out at the FoW site. A total of 101 zig-zag and vessel-based transects were performed using the Marine Scotland Science research vessel FRV Alba-na-Mara. During transects, the vessel moved against the prevailing horizontal currents. This unconventional design allowed the vessel to maintain a reasonably consistent trajectory despite the fast horizontal currents, and also sustain speeds suitable for recording foraging seabirds (5–15 km). Transects were spread across different tidal states to capture variance in the location and extent of hydrodynamic features. Transects were only performed when the sea state was less than 3 (Beaufort scale) and visibility was at least 300 m.\nDuring transects, two observers sat 5·6 m above sea level at the bow of the vessel and only recorded seabirds seen on the water surface. Flying seabirds were not recorded as they would not be actively foraging. Survey methods were based upon those outlined within the European Seabird at Sea (ESAS) methodology. To provide accurate positions, observers recorded seabirds seen on the sea surface into 1-min intervals, and only when they were perpendicular to the bow. Whenever seabirds on the sea surface were seen flushing before they were perpendicular to the bow, observers noted their approximate distance ahead of the vessel. Each observer covered one side of the vessel, and it was noted on which side seabirds on the sea surface were observed. These approaches enabled the position of any seabirds seen on the sea surface to be quantified with an estimated accuracy of approximately 300 m in most cases. Observers also recorded the behaviour of seabirds seen on the sea surface to discriminate between those which were actively foraging (diving or searching) and those which were resting.\nFor further details on the methods and results of the survey refer to the following link: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12646/full.\nThe study was performed across a total of 6 and 8 days in May and October, respectively during both 2012 and 2013, with May representing breeding seasons and October representing non-breeding seasons.\nEMEC Fall of Warness Boat-Based Wildlife Surveys (RESPONSE Project) is located in United Kingdom."

    "text": "2019 is set to be an incredibly interesting year for the Fintech community globally; 50% of ICOs have unsurprisingly gone south, Bitcoin’s price has dipped considerably and GDPR has taken its toll on the collection of data in Europe.\nWith that said, it’s not all doom and gloom especially as the implementation of PSD2 means that banking services are more available than ever.\nWith the possibility of a no-deal Brexit in the UK as well as a technical recession in South Africa, marketing is more imperative than ever to stimulate economic growth and that’s no different for the financial services sector. One of the standout companies for me in 2019 will be Starling Bank, which has effectively become a PSD2 marketplace for consumers who have different financial products but want one place for them all to live. One of the trends that Starling is capitalising on, is being a mobile-only app for banking. Lending Times reckons that 2019 will be the year in which payments and mobile banking will be worth £92 billion. A mobile-first approach to banking and advertising is definitely here to stay!\nA buzzword in most industries at the moment is artificial intelligence and I feel like we’re only really scratching the surface of what can be achieved.\nWe’ve had our clients queueing up to try out AI chatbots with the view to automating their sales processes but as with all new technology, there’s no best practice rulebook on how to increase conversions using chatbots. So far the results globally have been underwhelming. We implemented an AI chatbot called Drift for our client Hasteepay and the promise is that Drift’s conversational marketing platform allows businesses to transform their marketing with real-time one-on-one conversations and chatbots that qualify leads and book meetings for their sales team. The only issue with this so far has been that there are only a handful of routes that you can predefine with this AI, and so it’s not fully optimised to deal with HasteePay’s user experience. We feel like the best chatbots will integrate fully into the user experience and need to be flexible enough for user experience designers to work with them. With that said, we feel like artificial intelligence will be at the centre stage of anti-money laundering, fraud detection and customer analytics in the years to come.\nAsian Fintech is going crazy because of the growing middle class and a booming economy. Fintech also doing well in emerging markets – I would be remiss not to mention BitPesa in Kenya and Luno from South Africa which are the darlings of the African continent. Startupbootcamp, which has had some successes in European fintech is also starting in South Africa so there’s definitely interest. As a London mentor for Startupbootcamp, I often see really great startups coming out of South Africa and this year was no different. Our client, Aerobotics, is using drones to analyse crops and provide analytics in order for farmers to better insure their crops. They’ve had major bank interest from the likes of Nedbank and this clearly shows the trend of how traditional banks are teaming up with startups to bring innovation into their offerings. Hopefully, their marketing takes on a similar level of innovation because we’re still seeing large offline spend in emerging markets where mobile is becoming the de facto way of accessing the net.\nSpeaking of Insurtech, I’m seeing the on-demand economy driving massive investment in insurance startups that help consumers insure their valuables over the short term.\nTwo companies that I think are doing this really well are Dinghy which helps freelancers insure things like computers as well as Zego which is offering on-demand insurance for scooter drivers. One thing they’re both doing incredibly well is working their marketing messages back towards their mission which is to change the insurance sector in line with how the nature of work is changing. This is incredibly smart and is a trend worth following.\nAnd finally, a shoutout to our client Luno which has just been voted as the UK’s fastest growing startup by PRNewsWire. Although Bitcoin’s price has stalled somewhat, there is still increased buying of both Bitcoin and Ethereum and we’re happy to have helped them make this easier online."

    "text": "Early versions of the TFSI petrol engines found in the A4, A5 and Q5 have an manufacture design flaw which leads to high consumption of oil. The Piston rings inside the engines when built were the wrong size/ not sealed in correctly, this would allow small amounts of oil to leak around them. The oil would get into the cylinders and then burn off and lead to high consumption.\nBlack exhaust tips – the oil eventually burns out the exhaust system, mine were as black as my A3 TDI!\nIt seems that in 2015 Audi officially recognised this as an issue and started fixing on the quiet. Off the back of this i do feel sorry for anyone prior to this paying for this to be fixed or worse just living with this issue!\nAfter a call to Audi UK i found out that Audi has an official stage process to this to get it fixed.\nFirstly you need to get the official usage figure recorded by Audi, for this i used my local dealer. I left my A5 with them for a day whilst they drained the car of oil, changed oil breather (uprated design) and flashed the Engine ECU software to cope with the new design breather. The oil will be topped up to a specific measured amount and you will be asked to drive few hundred miles or when the oil light comes on.\nIn my case i drove about 500 miles and it used about 3/4 of a litre according to the MMI gauge, i took it back and got the measurement – just prior to going away with the car.\nThe Audi dealership you use will then report the findings with Audi UK (or your regional main Audi). I was asked various questions about where the car was purchased from and if it was under warranty.\nYour service record will also be photocopied and sent across, for me mine was 55K miles and nearly full audi service history – 2 independent garages did a a service, however they were Audi specialists so i assume this helped.\nAfter just over a week i was contacted by my dealership that Audi UK have agreed to do the work covering the cost in full. They will get the car in, take engine out strip it all down and replace the pistons, piston rings and con rods. They have said this will take about 3 days.\nThe cost of this if paying would be about £4000!\nIf when the engine is stripped down and damage is noticed inside the only option is to replace the engine and this of course will fix the issue."

He has since starred in a number of South Indian films, including Mani Ratnam’s \"Raavanan\" in 2010.\nThe actor made his foray into Bollywood last year with the film \"Aiyaa\" opposite Rani Mukherji, and is currently working on \"Aurangzeb\", which is being produced and distributed by Yash Raj Films – one of the largest Indian entertainment and production houses.\nRumour has it that Prithviraj has been roped in for \"Happy New Year\", a film by choreographer-turned-director Farah Khan. Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan have been confirmed as being part of the film, but Prithviraj’s role is yet to be officially confirmed. Speaking to The Hindu last week, the actor revealed that he had been involved in preliminary talks with the film’s team, but has not yet confirmed anything.\nIt would certainly be a good look for the actor to be in a film alongside two of Bollywood’s biggest stars, especially as \"Aiyaa\" didn’t do that well at the box office.

    "text": "Alain Resnais (b. 1922–d. 2014), born in Vannes, France, is one of the great cinematic innovators of the 20th and 21st centuries. In a career that spanned nearly seventy years and included nineteen feature films and more than twenty documentaries, Resnais produced an exceptional range of films that encompass a cross-section of genres and time periods. From the early commissioned documentaries, including Toute la mémoire du monde (1956), to his later explorations of the genres of the melodrama in Mélo (1986) or the musical in On connaît la chanson (1997), Resnais consistently engaged with, and moved beyond, cinematic conventions. Perhaps his most well-known works resist generic classification altogether: Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and L’Année dernière et Marienbad (1961) can be described as works that treat the question of memory, and of cinematic time itself. Resnais’s work is resolutely engaged with the political and social contexts of his time, and many of his early films tackle the most grimly iconic atrocities of the 20th century: the bombing of Guernica (Guernica, 1950), the Holocaust (Nuit et brouillard, 1955), the bombing of Hiroshima (Hiroshima mon amour), and the question of torture during the French-Algerian War (Muriel, 1963). These films treat the complex intersections of memory and trauma that marked France and Europe after World War II, and they are infused with a profound pathos and ethical sensibility that is particular to Resnais. This article charts the different facets of Resnais’s work, adopting a broadly chronological approach that highlights the major films, as well as Resnais’s relation to the New Wave, philosophy, and intermediality and collaboration.\nThere are many useful overviews of Resnais’s work. Armes 1968, Kreidl 1978, Sweet 1981, Prédal 1968, and Bounoure 1974 treat the early films, up to and including the 1960s and 1970s, while Prédal 1996 and Wilson 2006 also examine the films of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Some of these monographs adopt a thematic perspective: Benayoun 1980 and Monaco 1978 consider the question of imagination, and Wilson 2006 looks at memory and the senses in Resnais’s work. Resnais gave many interviews about his work over the course of his career, and many of these are collected in the Goudet 2002 Positif dossier, which also contains many excellent short readings of various films. The special edition of Contre bande (Special Issue: Alain Resnais) also brings together a range of French criticism on the director. Liandrat-Guigues and Leutrat 2006 adopts an all-encompassing approach that successfully situates Resnais’s work within his broader interests in literature, cartoons, theater, painting, and music.\nA concise early work that provides some useful biographical information and close readings of Resnais’s work, from the early documentaries to Je t’aime, je t’aime. The book also includes a detailed filmography, films stills, and on-set photographs.\nBenayoun, Robert. Alain Resnais: Arpenteur de l’imaginaire.

Alain Resnais. Boston: Twayne, 1978.\nAn impressively detailed early work that traces the evolution of Resnais’s cinematic style through the major fiction films.

    "text": "In addition, he writes that whoever contemplates this while reciting the Adon Olam in the morning is guaranteed not to have any misfortune befall him on that day; he’ll have a great day!\nThe ten verses of Adon Olam correspond to the sefirot, in order. The verse corresponding to the sefirah of victory is “He is my G-d and my living savior, and the rock of my birth-pains in a time of crisis.” Let us take a look at the words “a time of crisis.” In Hebrew “a time of crisis” equals 765.\n765 is the “minor part” (that in mathematics would be called the least significant digits) of the current Jewish year, 5765. In Jewish culture it is customary to use only this part in referring to the year on a daily basis.\nOne of the most well-known teachings of the Ba’al Shem Tov is that by meditating on a Hebrew word while praying (for instance, when reciting the Adon Olam), one can rearrange the word’s letters and hence change its meaning. The example he gives is using exactly these words “a time of crisis.” By rearranging its three letters “crisis,” in Hebrew, becomes “tzohar” the word for “threshold” or “radiance” (“tzohar” is one of the 13 synonyms for “light” in Hebrew, bringing to mind the image of “a light at the end of a tunnel”). Indeed, using the verse “Oh, for that day is great, there is none like it; and, it is a time of crisis for Jacob, and from it he will be redeemed” (Jeremiah 30:7), the Ba’al Shem Tov teaches that the crisis itself becomes the source of the redemption; the crisis which seems to signal “the end,” becomes a threshold for a new beginning of the good. According to Chassidic teachings, contemplating words in this manner has a real effect on reality, allowing us to clear our minds and to reformulate our understanding of where we are and what it is that we are doing. Suddenly, from this new perspective, opportunities present themselves and the Almighty helps us fashion them in a positive way. So, though this year may be a year of crisis, it is also a threshold for a new level of good and prosperity, a new level of Divine radiance.\nIn Kabbalah, the process of transforming the negative into the positive is known as “hamtakat hadinim beshorsham,” or “the sweetening of the judgments at their root.” Without going into the Kabbalistic meaning of this process, let us note that the root of the “judgments” can also refer to a word’s grammatical root in Hebrew. The root of the word for “crisis,” in Hebrew is: . But if we take this same word for “crisis” and treat it as if it were a root itself (that is, we are figuratively bringing it to the “root”) then as it turns out, there is only a single word that stems from this root: the word for “balm,” in Hebrew: .\nBalm is associated with healing and is considered a homeopathic remedy par excellence in the Bible. Jeremiah says: “Is there no balm in Gilad; is there no physician there? Why then is the health of my people not recovered?” (Jeremiah 8:22; see also Ibid. 51:8). Thus, elevating crisis to its root yields a remedy. In practical terms this means that elevating one’s consciousness to focus on G-d Himself in a time of crisis transforms the crisis into a threshold for healing and growth in the radiance of G-d.\nFor more on homeopathy in the Torah, see Rabbi Ginsburgh’s Body, Mind, and Soul, pp. 178ff. For more on elevating consciousness to focus on G-d Himself see Ibid., pp. 192ff."

And my pantry…I could stare at it for hours, it’s so big that I need to buy more food to fill it! Ok, so that’s an exaggeration, but you get the point.\nI actually organized my walk-in closet first, because, you know…I love clothes and shoes, so I had to claim almost the entire closet, sorry to the hubster.

And thanks for the pasta love, Annie!\nWe moved in over 2 months ago, and I JUST organized my walk-in closet last week!

    "text": "Some clients may have insight into how their childhood has affected their adult life, however some clients are unaware of the connection. Much more than a new edition, this is a true re-visioning as only Judith Rubin could do. For a client to understand the connections of their history to their present actions, therapists can help the client establish a roadmap of how they got to where they are in life today. It will also find a receptive audience within the larger research community where there is a rising commitment to expanding the theory and practice of research. In addition to the strength of the theoretical overview, this new edition offers many new chapters including those on cognitive-behavioral therapy and person-centered therapy. This momentum could stall if the client wants to consciously or unconsciously avoid specific problems.\nHe illustrates how practitioner-researchers can become involved in art-based inquiries during their educational studies and throughout their careers, and shows how new types of research can be created that resonate with the artistic process. Offering a rich array of sources and resources, the book will be of interest to clinicians and teachers in many fields, such as psychiatry, psychology, social work, counseling, art, and education. Approaches to Art Therapy, 3rd edition, is an essential resource in the assembly of any clinician's theoretical and technical toolbox, and in the formulation of each individual's own approach to art therapy. Mentalization Based Art Psychotherapy Dominik Havsteen-Franklin B. An Eclectic Approach to Art Therapy Harriet Wadeson Conclusion Index Series Title: Responsibility: edited by Judith Aron Rubin.\nGussak describes the role of the art therapist as an expert witness in a murder case, the way to use art as evidence, and the conclusions and assessments that professionals can draw from a defendant's artworks. The third edition of Approaches to Art Therapy brings together varied theoretical approaches and provides a variety of solutions to the challenge of translating theory to technique. Approaches to Art Therapy, 3rd edition, is an essential resource in the assembly of any clinician's theoretical and technical toolbox, and in the formulation of each individual's own approach to art therapy. Art therapists at all levels, as well as any mental health professional utilizing art in their clinical work, will find this new edition of value and interest. Art therapy can be very useful in these situations because the client can engage in creative expression and self-expression and not feel pressured to formulate insightful verbal insights.\nThe counselling approach that is chosen should best suit the client and their needs along with the skillset you have developed. Some have limited evidence and some have copious amounts of evidence. Moreover, a therapist will also be influenced by their first place of employment when deciding which counselling approach to use with their client. He examines the effectiveness of expert testimony as communicated by the prosecution, defense, and court, and weighs the moral, ethical, and legal consequences of relying on such evidence. Cognitive-Behavioral Art Therapy Marcia Rosal 18. Moreover, for all of the evidence in support of the effectiveness of the therapy, there is usually a component of criticisms directed towards the effectiveness of the therapy or the scientific approach taken to analyzing its usefulness.\nI honestly do not think I understood the integrative approach to art therapy until I picked this book up and started reading it and it was not my first semester of art therapy classes. The third edition of Approaches to Art Therapy brings together varied theoretical approaches and provides a variety of solutions to the challenge of translating theory to technique. Detailing an outstanding example of the use of forensic art therapy in a capital murder case, David Gussak, an art therapist contracted by the defense to analyze the images that were to be presented as evidence, recounts his findings and his testimony in court, as well as the future implications of his work for criminal proceedings. Jungian Art Therapy Nora Swan-Foster 9. Art therapy has commonly followed more psychodynamic and humanistic approaches.\nI have kept it and reread it many times and I highly recommend it for anyone in the field of art therapy—student and therapist alike. Clinical examples and nearly 100 illustrations are employed as the authors present the creative and effective treatment of patients. Much more than a new edition, this is a true re-visioning as only Judith Rubin could do. Chapter Five continues the theme of violence within families, and Chapter Six, 'The Cycle of Healing,' includes a discussion of resilience illustrated by a variety of stories from an integration of family and art therapy. Focusing-Oriented Art Therapy Laury Rappaport 16. This book is a wonderful contribution to efforts to encourage the highest standards of professional competence in art therapy.\nThe E-mail message field is required. Commentaries by well known art therapists follow each section of the book. Object Relations and Art Therapy Arthur Robbins 7. Discovery and Insight in Art Therapy Judith Rubin 5. This exciting new volume contains a diverse selection of chapters written to examine the current transitional phase of the profession where new paradigms of thinking and research methods are emerging due to the continued examination of old assumptions and development of new knowledge. The creator of seven books and thirteen films, she serves on the faculties of the psychiatry department at the University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Psychoanalytic Center in Pennsylvania. This book is packed with data on theory and practice with case material and art exercises.\nGestalt Art Therapy Janie Rhyne 12. Person-Centered Expressive Arts Therapy Natalie Rogers 13. A Theory-based Approach to Art Therapy draws on the latest research in the field and will be a valuable text for art therapy theorists, educators, students and researchers, as well as for other social practitioners interested in understanding how to integrate the arts into their practice. The introduction begins with a brief introduction to Randy and his Dad and Stepmother. The therapist and client work together to formulate a future vision for the client and then determine the series of steps it will take to achieve that vision. Therapy can help explore how these perceptions and thoughts influence current behaviour. This book provides a theory-based approach to research, teaching, and practicing art therapy, including verbal and arts based techniques, settings, art processes and analyses, and the principles of supervision, evaluation, and research."

My email changed and voila, I was no longer able to access my Pinterest account. Oh, it’s still there, just languishing and underfed.\nTo rectify this, I created a brand new Pinterest account and starting following myself (that would be my old account). Therefore I can repin all my old photos (the 1000s) onto my new site. Tedious? Yes. But something I can do while in line at the grocery store.\nHere are some sample pins, currently centered around my debut novel, Tarot: The Magician.\nI love the mystery of this photo. It’s called “Discovered” by David Dallilet. This reminds me of the Black Plague suits doctors would wear.\nThis painting, called “All Seeing” reminds me of Guiermo Del Toro’s work. Although the painting is by Sarah Jones.\nYes. I also adore books. In 2005, Swiss artist Jan Reymond began constructing elaborate installations each year, made of the old, unsold books as a last hurrah for the soon-to-be discarded objects.\nThis entry was posted in Art and tagged pinterest.\nYou have a very disturbing Pinterest, if these are just a few samples. Granted, the style of writing you do, but whew….. 😛 Glad you figured out a way to ‘save’ your pins! Creative.\nI looked back and you’re right. On the blog I mostly posted bizarre images. Those were the ones that were the most striking. Except, wow, that does paint an interesting picture of me, doesn’t it?\nThe book installation looks really cool. I like the overall look and that books were repurposed into something else, at least for awhile. I remember seeing a show about the middle ages where they had a black plague mask/suit similar to the painting. The All Seeing is actually pretty cool too.\nYup, I’m drawn to all things books so the book installation is awesome. Click over to the Pinterest site for a whole lot more book related art."

    "text": "The following standards are designed to provide for a systematic method of appointing qualified counsel to indigents in criminal cases. These standards address principles of eligibility and certification for trial, writs of habeas corpus, revocations of probation and counsel on appeal.\nBecause Navarro County counsel as well as out-of-county counsel available for indigent criminal appointment numbers fewer than twenty individuals, the judges of Navarro County are completely familiar with the proficiency levels of all local counsel. These guidelines provide for a high level of discretion to be exercised by judges, based upon their almost daily review of the conduct of a small number of attorneys. Navarro County indigent practice has always incorporated considerable judicial discretion in the appointment of attorneys, and the jurists of Navarro County, historically, have used utmost care in balancing the rights of indigent defendants and varying levels of attorney proficiency to achieve adequate representation. No doubt, the great majority of judges who comprise the rural judiciary have executed the same care.\nvi. If the magistrate is not authorized to appoint counsel and if the accused requests appointment of counsel, the magistrate shall transmit or cause to be transmitted the magistrate form and any other forms requesting appointment of counsel to the Indigent Defense Coordinator. (the appointing authority) The forms requesting appointment of counsel shall be transmitted without unnecessary delay, but not later than 24 hours after the person arrested requests appointment of counsel.\n3. An attorney shall submit by October 15th each year a statement that describes the percentage of the attorney's practice time that was dedicated to work based on appointments accepted in this county for adult criminal cases and juvenile delinquency cases for the prior 12 months that begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. The report must be submitted through the online form to the Texas Indigent Defense Commission/form prescribed by the Texas Indigent Defense Commission to the court administration office in the county.\n3. An attorney must have experience as 1st or 2nd chair in at least 3 felony case(s) tried to verdict before a jury. At least 3 of the trial(s) must have been felonies. The styles and cause numbers of these cases must be listed in the District Courts appointment application form.\nC. Removal from Appointment List - The judges and Indigent Defense Coordinator will monitor attorney performance on a continuing basis to assure the competency of attorneys on the list. An attorney may be removed or suspended, as appropriate, from one or more appointment lists by a majority vote of the judges.\niii. If an indigent defendant is arrested in another county based on this county’s warrant, counsel will be appointed within three working days of the Indigent Defense Coordinator's receipt of the request for counsel.\nv. If a defendant wishes to request counsel prior to the initial appearance, the forms required to request counsel may be obtained at the Texas Indigent Defense Commission’s website at http://tidc.tamu.edu/public.net/ or from: the District Clerk's office or Indigent Defense Coordinator. The defendant may submit these forms to: Indigent Defense Coordinator.\n1. If no case has been filed in the trial court, the appointing authority for misdemeanors is Indigent Defense Coordinator.\n2. If no case has been filed in the trial court, the appointing authority for felonies is Indigent Defense Coordinator.\n3. If the case has been filed in the trial court, the appointing authority is Indigent Defense Coordinator.\nii. The attorney fee voucher must be submitted within seven days of disposition of case with any supplemental documentation to be attached for fees exceeding the schedule."

    "text": "During my last trip to Kyiv, Dnipro and Donbas, I’ve been in several closed-door meetings with military staff and international strategists. The following text lists some of my observations and things I was told about realities of the war in Ukraine.\nAll information was provided under Chatham House Rules, so it is much more straight forward than what you would hear or read from official briefings and politicians’ statements. For the same reason, I won’t name any source, naturally.\nRight now, Ukraine faces some 36.300 separatists (most of them Ukrainians) at the front. While 2016 saw around 9.000 Russian troops in eastern Ukraine, this number declined to 3.000. “The problem is that they left their equipment all behind. High tech equipment.” Military academies and (Ukrainian) separatist army training bases work “highly efficient”, some still under Russian army command with many trainers being Russian-trained Ukrainians by now. They are now training “the 3rd generation” of fighters, meaning Russian-trained Ukrainians educate new Ukrainians. Separatist troops are trained on traditional weapons as well as state of the art Russian Army electronic warfare equipment, the invaders left-behind. This results in a well-trained enemy army.\nHowever, over the past months, Russians have reduced logistic and military support in Donetsk and Luhansk. The DNR/LNR military and political leaderships are panicking about this and consider having their own offensive operations against Ukraine, fearing Russia might look for “diplomatic solutions” in which they might cease to exist.\nRight now, separatist/Russian forces of the first and second army corps have 478 operational tanks, 848 APCs and 732 artillery pieces inside Ukraine. Approximately the same amount of equipment is located directly on the Russian side of the occupied territories and can be deployed to the territories within less than one day (with Russian soldiers operating most of the weapons systems).\nWhat the Ukrainian army needs at the front – and hopes to receive from the US – is “night vision equipment, jamming systems, radio intelligence tools and secure communication systems, especially to operate UAVs”.\nOne quite bold argument why drones must be equipped with night vision and laser targeting equipment was, that Ukraine wants to see where it returns fire. “70% of their artillery and mortar positions are located in close proximity to civilian structures in urban areas. Most of the shelling occurs at night. If we return fire, we would like to see what we hit. This would reduce the risk of hitting civilians.” The officer said that Ukraine must strike back if the pro-Russian fire in violation of Minsk threatens the lives of their forces. They do this almost daily, “endangering our own civilians” (in the occupied areas). They want to change the situation, but need more foreign support to do so.\nAlso, separatists occasionally use entrenched BMP-1 some km from the front as “ballistic weapons”, using their main gun to shell the Ukrainian front “like mortars”. This tactic is used to avoid being spotted by OSCE monitors. It also only very seldomly causes damage or casualties.\nThe European Union, also Germany, deny Ukraine the military support they want, because the EU wants the Ukrainian army “to punch below its fighting weight”. It knows Putin is the aggressor but also has no full trust in Ukraine’s commitment to the Minsk agreement. It fears, nationalist forces could win the upper hand via democratic elections or within the military structure and launch a surprise offensive to regain what belongs to Ukraine in the east.\nSome figures within the Ukrainian political and military sphere see this as the only chance as Minsk does not seem to return any square meter to its rightful owner. At the same time, the Ukrainian army feels – and is – much stronger than in 2014 and could throw its weight into the battle to see if it can recapture entire Donbas. However no one thinks that Poroshenko would order such an attack as another defeat would mean the end of his political career. To make sure, nobody in the Ukrainian leadership does, the EU wants Ukraine to remain under-equipped to a certain degree. Also it is afraid that IF Ukraine’s army became a proper opponent to what Russia can send it at any moment, the conflict could spiral out of control.\nThe Ukrainian army position on the diplomatic initiative is: “Russia suffers under the sanctions, keeping them in place is the only way to eventually solve the conflict due to negotiations”. Some experts think that this implies, lifting the sanctions against Russia could make the Ukrainian government and army turn to “Plan B” as mentioned above.\nAsked about OSCE observations that the Ukrainian army sometimes advances into the grey area, officers made it clear that they regard the – signed also by Russia! – September 19, 2014 contact line as the real one, according to Minsk. This means the army sees advances into the grey zone “to supply our citizens in it” and possibly take new positions as its full right.\nThe grey zone, meaning points behind what Ukraine holds now but what it regards as on its side of the September 19, 2014 contact lin,e reaches “between 200 meters and 7 kilometres” into not-held territory, sometimes held by separatists, sometimes held by nobody. Thus, it includes “hundreds of settlements” which Ukraine regards as under its protection according to the first Minsk agreement. The army denies that entering these areas violates Minsk and left open, whether it could install permanent positions inside this area. For now, only temporary advances are on the agenda.\nRussian-speaking people could turn to Russia, fleeing to it or even rise up in the eastern and southern regions, trying to make those areas part of Russia. By the way: All experts agree that Russia is not better off economically, just more successfully creating that image with its propaganda, also received among many “neutral” Ukrainians.\nBecause of all this, economic experts assume that Ukraine is “too big to fail” and must be economically secured at any price. So the fight against the economic downturn is closely connected to the fight against Russia’s hybrid war on the country and the fight against corruption.\nAgainst the backdrop of an – again – escalating war in Eastern Ukraine, it was revealed today that Russia extended its “support for the rebels” or rather: supply of its troops by a further mean, namely by a direct train connection from Russia into occupied Donbas.\nGiven the fact that the Russian invasion command did everything to conquer the important railway knot of Debaltseve and seeing a steady escalation in Russian-led violence in Eastern Ukraine over the last weeks, the assumption that full-scale hostilities will resume until summer seems rather obvious. Thus, it is no surprise that the Russian army needs to create a strong and steady supply line to its forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Rumors that such line was established popped up here and there over the last 2 months, however, solid evidence was missing so far.\nThis changed today, when the Ukrainian Twitter user “Lenz Gottfried” uploaded a picture of two Russian “hybrid” troops, hugging at an undosclosed train station in front of what seemed to be a (state-owned) Russian Railways cargo train, packed with ammunition boxes.\nAccording to the uploader of the picture, the boxes contain ammunition for the «Акации» / 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled artillery, however this type of artillery system is not known to have been deployed by Russian forces so far. While this description might be a (rather unimportant) mistake given the clearly military cargo inside the wagons, the exact geolocation of the picture inside Ukraine was crucial to verify the claim that the scene played inside Ukraine. This process needed no less than 2 hours, in which I matched more than 50 train stations inside occupied Donbas with the picture, searching for a facility with the properties and objects that can be seen in it. Finally, I found the right one and was able to confirm that despite the small ammunition type error, the scene indeed shows what it claims, namely a direct Russian army supply line into Ukraine’s Luhansk region via railway, more precisely the town of Sukhodil’s‘k, around 10 km from the border with Russia. The below picture shows the analytical chart that verifies the location as well as the way, the train probably took to get there.\nAs it can be seen in the chart above, the train likely entered via the Russian-occupied Izvaryne border crossing, which (despite claims to have done so) the Ukrainian army was never able to reach since the start of the invasion in April last year. Thus, it served as a safe passage for Russian troops and equipment, crossing it in vehicles as well as the notorious “humanitarian aid convoys”, since then. However its use for the illegal entry (aka invasion) of Russian army-organized and -stuffed trains hasn’t been proven so far. This changed today.\nThe emergence of the train in Sukhodil’s’k, 18 kilometers of tracks into Ukraine, is – for sure – only the tip of the iceberg. At this very location, no Russian arms are needed right now and the town only serves as a transit point for that kind of carriage. Instead the tracks, lead towards the front near Stanytsia Luhanska in the north and practically endlessly towards the west, where fighting increased over the last 4 weeks. More such deadly cargo, transported by train, should and will be found along these axes, then however, probably not in Russian Railways wagons anymore.\nFinally, the first appearance of Russian state trains, filled with ammunition, inside Ukraine, is another stark reminder that this conflict is far from over. Instead the Russian side takes a – well-documented – deep breath to come back with all its “hybrid” force and take more territory inside Ukraine; probably before this summer. The usage of Russian trains to facilitate that carefully and long-planned move is just another logical step in Russia’s escalation ladder and thanks to the “media friendly” invasion troops, its revelation was just a question of time.\nEight days after the fall of Debaltseve (article), many analysts still believe, the worst in terms of fighting might be over in eastern Ukraine and Russia’s thirst for more territory appeased. Fighting activity continuously decreased during the last days along the border of occupied Donbas and yesterday was the first day of no Ukrainian fatalities since the signing of the Minsk 2 agreement on February 12. Still, this impression deceives.\nThe prediction, I stated in my last article, that large parts of the offensive Russian forces which were active in and around Debaltseve moved south after their victory there and will soon turn up in the greater Donetsk area as well as near the southern coastal city of Mariupol was meanwhile confirmed by multiple analysts, including several sources on the ground in southern Donetsk region. However, what seems not to have been realized by analysts and international media organizations yet is that the question, whether or not an attack towards Mariupol will take place or not has already been answered. It started the moment, Debaltseve fell to the invasion army.\nIn early February, Ukrainian national guard forces from Regiment Azov were not willing to obey the suicidal “defense only” strategy by the military and political leadership in Kiev and decided to go on the attack (article), amid a weak Russian / local separatists-held frontline east of the city (as most forces were active around Debaltseve). Within 2 days, they recaptured around 120 km² of Ukrainian land and established new fortified positions in a number of towns, some 10-15 east of Mariupol.The below (professional) map gives a good impression of what could be regained and put back under Urainian control during this offensive.\nBut the joy was only brief. 5 days later, on February 16, Russian forces started massive attacks on the front, pushing Azov troops out of Shyrokyne and to the town’s eastern outskirts (geolocated) in a first stage of their counterattack. Several days of relative calm followed, but on February 23, their offensive gained pace again, using all kind of weapons – of course – forbidden in the Minsk 2 agreement – and even Russian air force surveillance planes over the occupied territory. The below detailed map shows what was used where and what the initial situation in terms of territorial possession at that time was.\nDue to the (anti!-)Ukrainian strategy of adhering to the Minsk 1+2 agreements, defending Azov troops could only fight back with small arms and mortars, by far not strong enough to resist the fresh Russian push, executed by forces coming from central Donbas via Telmanove as well as via Novoazovsk and thus directly from Russian army and invasion bases across the border (article). Reports from the Information Resistance group say up to 600 invasion forces stand ready to take part in the offensive as well as dozens of tanks and armored fighting vehicles, not to speak of heavy artillery and MLRS systems.\nAs a logic consequence of the uneven (allowance to use) force, Ukrainian troops initially had to withdraw from Kominternove and shortly after from Pavlopil and its tiny suburb Pyshchevyk, meaning a loss of some 70% of the territory, Regiment Azov liberated earlier this month. Not even today, as the Ukrainian ministry of internal affairs report the use of Russian army T-72 tanks to attack Regiment Azov positions near Shyrokyne, the Ukrainian army command would give its troops the needed artillery cover. The below map shows the situation as it appears according to all available reports on February 25.\nLast but not least, many people keep asking if Russian forces will attack Mariupol itself and capture it in another step to build a land corridor to (also-)occupied Crimea. There should be doubt about that for the coming weeks at least. While some analysts believe, the Russian army and local separatists might directly attack or bypass and encircle the town, the cost for that move might be massive and possibly too high for both sides, especially taking into account that – different from Debaltseve – here both sides will have a steady streeam of resupplies and reinforcements until cutting the opponent’s supply lines with extreme force. Thus, the more likely scenario in the short term is that Russian forces will try to get back into the comfortable situation of controlling all smaller settlements east of Mariupol, being able to attack military and civilians targets in and around the town like it was the case between September last year and January 2015. Doing this, they would be able to inflict constant smaller casualties on the fixed Ukrainian line of defense, keeping the conflict boiling on a low but steady flame. At the same time, it would enable them to raise the stakes (attack Mariupol itself) whenever their supreme command in Moscow feels to do so, without having to move larger contingents of men and material (more than 5 kilometers).\nFinally what we might see during the next weeks and probably months will rather be an offensive towards and not on Mariupol. However, this offensive is already happening as we speak, kept dead quiet by both, the Russian and the Ukrainian government, but painfully felt by mostly volunteer Ukrainian defenders on the ground as well as civilians, coming back under Russian rule or – like so many others – being forces to flee to Mariupol itself or other safer regions in Ukraine."

Unlike a traditional office, coworking spaces consist of members who work for a range of different companies, ventures, and projects. Because there is little direct competition or internal politics, they don’t feel they have to put on a work persona to fit in. Working amidst people doing different kinds of work can also make one’s own work identity stronger.\nIn 2017, there were 13,800 coworking spaces globally. The Cooperative Venture Workspace is proudly one of them in Portsmouth, NH.\nThis is more than office space for rent. It’s a decision that has direct benefits for you and your business."

Every class in Key Stage 1 have two school council members that hold their post for a term. At the beginning of every term new school council members are selected through an election process.\nIn order to be on the School Council children must deliver a short speech on what they would like to improve at the school. They are then voted for by the members of the class and two children are chosen to be the representatives.\nThe School Council team meet up every Thursday lunchtime and discuss the topic of focus. Last year the School Council supported Children in Need, Sports relief and our Anti-bullying week. They helped raise money at the summer fete and helped guide the school into looking after their playground and the toilets more responsibly.\nThe School Council has a mission statement which is displayed next to their board in the school. A copy of this can be found below.\nOur School Council will include children who set a good example to follow and encourage the school values. They will listen to all pupils and help give them a voice to share opinions. The school Council will help to make everybody feel included, a part of our community and feel happy and safe."

Grace was vice-captain of the university hockey team, whose members raised almost £6,000 for Lincoln cancer charity Candles and the Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, with a charity match and an online campaign .\nHer disappearance sparked a frantic search by New Zealand police and her father flew out in a desperate bid to find her.\nGrace&apos;s two brothers, Michael, 29, and Declan, 26, and their mother, Gillian, said Grace had a \"passion to see the world\" and revealed she had been planning a second long-haul trip to Asia.\nMichael told the Sunday Times : \"She had decided, &apos;once I&apos;ve done this bit, I want to go to the other side&apos;.\n\"She had a passion to see the world before she settled into a job. Her mind was set that she wanted to do this thing.\"\nHe also revealed the family had received almost 1,000 messages of sympathy and support from around the world - many from complete strangers.\nMichael said: \"I read one from Mexico last night on Facebook. It&apos;s been reassuring reading the condolences, the nice messages that people have been sending.\n\"[It is often] random people taking the time to write a letter to us - to someone they don&apos;t know from across the world.\"\nThe family also issued this statement: \"Grace went off to travel the world in mid-October and arrived in New Zealand on November 20.\nThe family also paid tribute to investigating officers in New Zealand.\nThey said: \"We would like to thank the people of New Zealand for their outpouring of love, numerous messages, tributes and compassion."

The pattern in which the Question Paper is set is quite different from the style in which the course structure is actually defined. Consider the below mentioned points/questions at the time of preparation.\nGiven positive integers a and b, there exist whole numbers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, 0 ≤ r < b.\nStep 1: Apply the division lemma to find the whole numbers q and r such that, a = bq + r, where ; 0 ≤ r < b.\nStep 2: Now if r = 0, then the HCF of given numbers is b. If r ≠ 0, then apply Euclid’s lemma again to b and r.\nStep 3: Continue this process till the remainder comes out to be zero. The divisor at this stage will be HCF (a, b). Also, HCF(a, b) = HCF(b, r).\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every composite number can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation is unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur."

    "text": "Spent Friday driving from Branson to Pigeon Forge. Definitely a long haul. Forgot about switching back to Eastern time so lost an hour on top of that. It seemed my virtually rain-free trip would be spoiled, morning forecast called for 60%+ chance of thunderstorms on Saturday. Miraculously, the park got virtually no rain, the storm system veered just west of Pigeon Forge.\nGot there around 9:15 and boarded at Tram Stop B. \"B is for Butterfly.\" Walking through the front areas before rope drop there is a very nice fountain. Also, due to the threat of rain, there weren't many people here at opening. The duck population on the midways outnumbered the people population. Unfortunately, all of the ducks were holding park maps and headed the same place I was. Oh c'mon, those baby ducks aren't even tall enough to ride.\nWild Eagle. The theming is well done. There's an awesome massive eagle statue at the entrance, and Dolly herself recorded a special song just for the ride. Flyyy Eagle, Flyyy Eagle, Wild Eagle Flyyyy.... (thankfully there is more than that). The trains themselves have eagle heads with wings spanning the middle of each row.\nEagle's zero-g roll, which comes right after the first loop, was my favorite element here. You really do feel like you're flying. I preferred the back. This one's worth doing front seat at least once though, there are some great legchopper effects there in the second half that had me pulling my knees up. From a pure ride standpoint, now having ridden all 3 of B&M's US Wing Coasters, GateKeeper is better, but I enjoyed Wild Eagle quite a bit more than X-Flight. I wouldn't classify any of the 3 as \"intense\" but that's not really a negative in my book. It's a solid crowd pleasing design, they are fun to ride, and they have a certain -- dare I say -- majestic quality, which isn't an adjective I'd use to describe many other coasters.\nAfter 4 laps on Eagle (max 10 minute wait this early in the morning), Tennessee Tornado was nearby so walked on. One of the last Arrow loopers, and now my second favorite of its type (Loch Ness is still first, those interlocking loops are so pretty.) Fairly smooth with virtually no headbanging and the tunnel drop is sweet. Rode it a second time. Next was Blazing Fury. Nearly identical to SDC's Fire In The Hole (the former was based on the latter), even the ride ops were serenading departing trains with a shout of \"Fire in the hole!\" However, this one has no splashdown, apparently they took it out a couple years back. Still a fun dark coaster.\nWalking back through the upper half of the park, did Mystery Mine twice. This ride is disorienting in a good way and hard to describe. Part indoor, part outdoor, and very unique. But bangs your head around in a couple spots. Kept going to Thunderhead. A very solid woodie, no single element is outstanding (the station flyby is slick though) but has some good airtime moments throughout its lengthy course and keeps up a good rate of speed.\nWent back to Thunderhead, max 10 minute wait so got 4 more rides on that, 2 more on Eagle, 1 more on Tornado. For a Saturday I sure am riding a lot. Then took a swing on Barnstormer, funny this was my first S&S swing of the season. The \"giant barn\" theme fits this ride type well (SDC's swing is similarly themed).\nI passed on dessert before but was wanting some now. Exiting Barnstormer, I walked to the nearby Grist Mill and -- a la Toucan Sam -- followed my nose inside. Cinnamon bread. Oh goodness this is delicious. You get a decent sized loaf served warm and fresh, there's enough to share, or in my case take some home. I then headed to Celebrity Theater for the Great American Country Show. Shows aren't really my thing -- my last was way back in 2008 (CP's Misadventures of Molly and Maverick) -- but considering Dollywood's reputation, I made an exception. I don't feel qualified to critique in detail, so I'll just say the production values were top-notch and I liked it. But given a do-over (or hopefully if I visit Dollywood again!) I probably would have selected a \"smaller\" show. Looking back I think the Country Show is Dollywood's \"biggest\" this season in terms of scale.\nThere were a couple hours left til close, and all I really wanted was a couple night rides on Eagle. I took some time to walk around the Village and Country Fair sections, as I hadn't been though them yet. Rode the train, which actually travels a bit outside the park boundary through some heavily wooded areas. Rode the nearby carousel after the train ride.\nThen started walking back towards Wild Eagle (hit Blazing Fury again on the way) and got there around 9 PM. Got 4 more rides in before closing at 10. This thing is even sweeter after dark. No lighting here, helps that much of the course is surrounded by trees. As a bonus, they were doing fireworks at 9:30. Soaring on Eagle in the dark while watching fireworks? EXCELLENT! And a pretty fitting finale to cap my vacation!"

    "text": "CARACS, Venezuela (AP) — In life, Venezuela's exuberant leader Hugo Chavez often captivated supporters by bursting into song, even the occasional dance. Now that he's gone, supporters are turning to the musical arts to help immortalize him.\nA state-sponsored biographical ballet premieres on Saturday, with dozens of performers recounting Chavez's life, from humble roots, to failed coup, to international fame as leader of Venezuela's socialist revolution.\nThe hour-long show, presented by Venezuela's National Dance Company, blends classic and contemporary choreography, and draws on a range of music including Venezuelan folk melodies, African rhythms and symphonic scores.\nPerformers use simple dances to depict Chavez's childhood in a humble house with a mud floor, and his days roaming the streets selling homemade papaya sweets known as spiders.\nThe ballet, entitled \"From Spider-Seller to Liberator,\" shows him shelving his dream of being a major league baseball pitcher to join the army at age 17. Then audience sees a disillusioned Chavez dancing against the background of the country's 1989 riots, in which several hundred people died in the streets.\nAt a climactic moment, Chavez storms the Venezuelan political stage like a hurricane in 1992, leading failed coup attempt.\nChavez was imprisoned, but not before scoring a few precious moments of airtime in which he grabbed the nation's attention, telling followers he had failed \"for now.\" The ballet is debuting on the 22nd anniversary of the failed coup.\nSix years after being sent to prison, Chavez he came to power and remained at the helm of the country until he died of cancer in 2013. The ballet ends with Chavez converted into a disembodied force of justice and socialism.\nOn the street outside the theater, passersby were unsurprised that the late leader has gotten another commemoration.\n\"Chavez has become mythic, whether you like it or not,\" said 23-year-old student Carlos Lozada. \"He'll be here as long as the Chavistas remain in power.\""

    "text": "Mexico City is the capital of Mexico. As an “alpha” global city, Mexico City is one of the most important financial centers in the Americas. Colonia Centro is the business, banking, and historic center of Mexico City. Within Colonia Centro, is Centro Histórico. Here you’ll find historic landmarks, important public buildings, the partially unearthed Aztec ruins of the Great Temple, and numerous museums. This is our guide to the best places to run in Mexico City, Mexico.\nWithin Colonio Centro is Chapultepec Forest (Bosque de Chapultepec) — is Mexico City’s largest oasis and one of its running highlights. It is divided into three sections, and home to forests, lakes and several important sights and attractions. In between Colonia Centro and Chapultepec Forest lies Zona Rosa, which is one of the city’s most touristy areas. South of Zona Rose lie the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods. These bohemian neighborhoods feature the city’s hippest cafes and bars, from cutting-edge restaurants to offbeat shops, art galleries, and nightclubs.\nOther running highlights in Mexico city are the Coyoacan and San Angel neighborhoods. Not far from the city, El Ocotal, Cuemanc, Bosque de Tlalpan, and Forest of Aragon are worthy running destinations.\nThere are two obstacles when running in Mexico City: altitude and pollution. Located at an altitude of 7,350 ft in the Valley of Mexico (a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico), it is important to allow yourself to become acclimated to the elevation before pushing yourself. Pollution is also a reality in Mexico City. Try planning your runs in the morning or the evening, and the air quality will be better.\n**Big thanks to Go! Running Tours for their help outlining the best running routes in Mexico City**.\nMexico City is huge but there are various forms of public transit to help you get around. The quickest form of transportation is the metro system, consisting of 12 lines with 195 stations. All lines operate from 5am to midnight weekdays, 6am to midnight Saturday and 7am to midnight Sunday and holidays. Peseros (also called microbúses or combis) are gray-and-green minibuses operated by private firms. They follow fixed routes, often starting or ending at metro stations, and will stop at virtually any street corner. Route information is randomly displayed on cards attached to the windshield. The city’s bus rapid transit line is the Metrobús. The metrobús stops at metro-style stations in the middle of the street, spaced at three- to four-block intervals. Buses and peseros operate from around 5am till 10pm daily, depending on the route. Electric trolleybuses generally run until 11:30pm.\n“Bosque de Chapultepec” (Chapultepec Forest) is the largest city park in the Western Hemisphere and is often referred to as Mexico City’s \"lungs\". We've mapped out a 3.6 mile park loop, and 5k loops of El Sope and Minor Lake.\nCentrally located park located in the trendy Condesa neighborhood provides an urban oasis for runners. A loop of the trails and paths is about 1 km, so you'll have to do some laps.\nThis is a 6.2 mile tour of some of Mexico City's most important and historic sites, starting from the Zócalo metro station. Note that on Sundays, Reforma Avenue is closed to traffic until mid-day -- a special bonus for runners!\nA 3 mile tour of Coyoacán, a quaint neighborhood is known for its cobblestone and bohemian flavor. Includes some parks, pretty residential streets, and some sites including Templo de San Juan Bautista and the Frida Kahlo Museum.\nA stunningly beautiful neighborhood of cobblestone streets, Colonial-Era homes, as well as several worthwhile museums south of the city center. Mexico City’s Secretary of Tourism named the San Angel neighborhood a Barrio Magico (Magic Neighborhood).\nA forest in the Cuajimalpa delegation in Mexico City. The best time to visit is on the weekends, when it is bustling with runners and walkers. There are native tree species such as fir, ash and pine. A running circuit of about 2.15 miles is very popular.\nCanal Cuemanco, in the eastern part of the city, was the venue for rowing competitions in the 1968 olympic games. A paved 5K path around the canal makes for a great place to run away from Colonia Centro. Great views of volcanoes and mountains.\nThe Bosque de Aragón is a park located in the Gustavo A. Madero, near the International Airport of Mexico City. There is a 2.5 km paved path surrounding a fountain and a second 5 km dirt path around the perimeter of the park.\nForest of Tlalpan is perhaps one of the best known by runners, athletes, and nature lovers who live south of Mexico City. The five different running tracks, and natural beauty make this forest one of the favorite places for exercise. Accessible by public transport.\nMexico City enjoys mild, pleasant weather (great for running) year round. It’s climate is classified as subtropical highland due to its tropical location and high elevation. The average high is between 70 an 85 (21 to 28 12 to °C) throughout the year. Nights can be cool, as low as 5C in thw winter months. October through May is the city’s dry season, and from June through September is considered the “rainy season”. During the summer months it rains on average once a day, though the rain rarely lasts longer than a few hours. Due to the city’s location near the equator, there is not great variation in daylight length.\nThere are numerous options for lodging in Mexico City. Some of the most reasonable places are in the Centro Histórico, while more luxurious accommodations, are concentrated in Polanco and the Zona Rosa. Staying in Centro Histórico and Zona Rosa provides access to the Historic Downtown route from your front door. Similarly, staying in Polanco (bordering Chapultepec Forest), has easy access to running routes in the forest. South of Zona Rose lie the Roma and Condesa neighborhoods. These bohemian neighborhoods feature the city’s hippest cafes and bars, from cutting-edge restaurants to offbeat shops, art galleries, and nightclubs. Condesa is close to the Chapultepec Forest routes, whereas routes from Roma are accessible through Metro transportation.\nThere aren’t as many specialty running shops in Mexico City as in some other cities, but here are a few.\nTodos a Correr Anzures and Santa Fe Locations. Specialty Run Store. Group Run Saturday 8:00am from the Anzures Store.\nTrailsport Carries a wide variety of specialty items for running, triathlon and cycling.\nMinimuri Location varies. Running club with free trainings.\nTotal Running Location varies. Running club with free trainings.\nMexico City Half Marathon July.\nRock ’n’ Half Marathon March."

If the information is accurate, it will mean a total of around 30,000 troops split into three divisions.\nAt the same time, NATO wants to send 4,000 soldiers, mostly American and British, to the Baltic States and Poland. This graph is being used as a propaganda tool to make it appear that 4,000 'defensive' NATO personnel are facing off against 30,000 \"aggressive\" Russians.\nFor starters, the Russian units will be stationed exclusively in Russian sovereign territory. The concept of a country keeping armed forces on its own soil is hardly revolutionary. By contrast, these American and British servicemen and women will be very far away from home.\nAlso, the figures are completely misrepresented. As the image below shows, it is Russia which is outnumbered. And vastly so.\nIt seems NATO's fans in western media are \"weaponizing information\" to deliver misleading messaging in their \"hybrid war\" against Russia. \"The menace of unreality\" indeed."

    "text": "On November 6th, people from across the country voted in their state’s Midterm Elections. Up for vote were 34 Senate seats, all of the seats in the House, and 36 gubernatorial seats. The Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, 199 in the house, and 25 governors. The Democrats have 45 Senate seats, 223 house seats, and 23 governors. The other two Senate seats, which are the Florida and the Mississippi, are both leaning Republican as are the other two gubernatorial races. In the House, 6 seats are leaning Republican and 4 are leaning Democrat. This means that the Republicans have a majority in the Senate and will most likely have a majority among governors, whereas the Democrats have the majority in the House.\nJust looking at the numbers, this would not seem to be a win for the Republicans as they lost the House, which they recently controlled. However, if you look at previous elections, this is a victory for them. In 2010, which was the first midterm election under President Obama, the Democrats lost 6 senate seats and 63 house seats. In 2002, however, the Republicans kept both Houses under President Bush. This makes sense, given the political climate at the time and the war just beginning in Afghanistan. In 1994, during President Clinton’s first term, the Democrats lost 9 Senate seats and also lost 54 House seats. Given the history of first-term midterm elections, President Trump gaining seats in one of the chambers is a victory for the Republicans. Also, keeping the Senate is arguably more important than keeping the House. With control of the Senate, Trump can get his court appointments confirmed. The biggest problems with not having control of the House is the possibility of impeachment and a block of any future tax cuts. However, Trump has already gotten his big tax cut through, so he isn’t looking to do another one very soon. Also, impeachment isn’t a problem because the Senate has to remove the President from office, which won’t happen with a Republican Senate. Keeping the Senate will be more important for Trump than keeping the House because he can still get his appointments confirmed by the Senate.\nThis is why this was a victory of the Republicans. They beat history and gained a few seats in the Senate. However, they lost the House. The was a lesser evil for Trump, because he can do more with a Republican Senate than a Republican House. Even though the Democrats gained the House, this year was not a victory for them. It was still a decent election for them, because they took control of one of the chambers, but the Republicans still got what they needed to achieve their goals.\nThe House – With California’s 21st Congressional District, the last undecided race of the 2018 midterms, and the vast majority of election wins certified, the numbers are in: Democrats gained 39 House seats, securing a solid 234-seat majority for the next session. Central to their victory was the political shift among sparsely populated suburban areas that voted solidly Republican in 2016, delivering a net Democratic gain of 15 seats. Likewise, densely populated suburban districts that voted solidly Democrat in 2016 shifted more Democratic, with 12 more seats flipping. Overall, the shift was most profound in districts that voted for Romney and Trump in previous elections, accounting for one-third of Democratic pickups – a sharp rebuke of Republican policies that have ostracized many independent and conservative voters alike.\nThe Senate – In the Senate, Democrats fared better than expected, losing only 2 seats for a 53-seat Republican majority against a brutal electoral map: 74% of senate seats up for election were held by Democrats, the most seats any non-presidential party had to defend in midterms since 1914. In addition, Democrats overperformed in nearly every state, beating even partisan leans of 25+ points in states that voted overwhelmingly for Trump, like West Virginia – which he had previously won with a 36% margin.\nThe Voters – Both parties’ bases were highly motivated, with voter turnout increasing nearly 10% from the 40% national average; in Texas alone, voter turnout increased 14% to 46% total. Democrat Beto O’Rourke came to within 3 points of Republican Ted Cruz by winning over burgeoning urban voters that already, in five counties alone, encompass 43% of Texas’ population. The combination of high urban population growth and continued high voter turnout is projected to make Texas a swing state by 2024, and much more competitive in 2020, when Senator John Cornyn’s seat is up for election.\nThe Future – The recent news about Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference and current Democratic control of the House and its Judiciary Committee suggest more conflict ahead. It is necessary among Democratic and Independent voters to protect the Special Counsel – himself a lifelong Republican, former Marine, and 12-year FBI director – from executive interference. However, many Americans expect legislative gridlock in the coming session to stall policy-making at a time when national debt interest, accruing faster due to a recent tax overhaul and spending bill, will surpass defense spending. Moreover, the international status quo increasingly demands unified action.\nMy Opinion – Keeping in mind the above, the American people have delivered their most resounding verdict yet on the current status quo – one of bitterness, partisanship, and sociopolitical division ordained by populist demagoguery – by voting for checks and balance, rule of law, and reason in candidates professing different views than a Republican contingent that seems bent on abandoning its foundations of fiscal responsibility and constitutionality for political expediency, all the while championing the burning effigy of moral integrity. Its base, the Great Silent Majority of working-class, suburban, law-abiding taxpayers readily abandoned the vitriol and incessant scandals ushered in by this administration in favor of either tepid enthusiasm or the Democratic party. At a time when both parties are becoming more radical, and younger generations are expressing apathy or disdain for the democratic process, the solution is not to set fire to the opposing camp – calling upon an army of horrors, “trigger-words,” slippery slopes, or straw men – but to recognize the true enemy of any self-governing people: fear itself."

    "text": "Under what’s known as a contingency fee arrangement, your attorney receives a fee only if you receive monetary compensation, in the form of an out-of-court settlement or an award after trial. The contingency fee will be a percentage of your total compensation. If you don’t get any money, neither does the attorney. When hiring lawyers for wrongful termination in Oakhurst, Florida agree to work on your case for a contingency fee, the percentage they’ll charge can vary quite a bit—from less than 25% to more than 40%—depending on where you live and the individual attorney. Often, they’ll ask for an up-front “retainer” (a sort of down payment) against the hourly fees. Then they’ll withdraw the fees as they earn them and give you an accounting of any balance. As enforced through the at-will rule, wrongfully does not refer to the termination being mean or the boss singled me out because he did not like me. The termination must violate a protected class or fundamental public policy.\nDespite the fact that the worker had previously been late only once, the boss terminates the worker, stating that she has a right to do so pursuant to the employment at will doctrine. The boss’s assertion is incorrect. By passing out the memo, she created an implied employment contract, and the worker can bring a claim for wrongful termination. This is known as a constructive discharge. If the employee had a contractual right to continued employment, the employer can be held liable. The concept of a constructive discharge is really just a way for the legal system to hold employers accountable when they try to get rid of employees in a disingenuous manner. This is in stark contrast to the Wrongful Termination in Oakhurst in other countries, which requires employers to have a sufficient reason for terminating an employee."

    "text": "City Closet Storage College Point – Having a youngster, one simply can not think of any well-organized house. Kids are by nature very naughty. They wish to throw their stuff all around and keep their stuff disorganized. If you want your residences to be sorted out as well as you want your child to learn the right behavior of organizing his stuff in a genuine great way, then surprise him a wardrobe organizer. The closest brought should be solely dedicated to your son or daughter and not for you or other people.\nMake him create a sense of possessiveness towards his new wardrobe like his toy. You’ll find many closets designed on the market. But here you can’t make a blind choice for a wardrobe organizer. As it is likely to be a surprise to your child, it ought to be a kid’s wardrobe system. The appearance of the wardrobe also should be considered a child’s favorite. The color shouldn’t be too bright, make an effort to paste images of cartoons, of stickers of your child’s favorite toys and games etc in order to make his wardrobe organizer little more attractive and his favorite.\nMake sure that the wardrobe organizer has enough areas in it. As your child will be having hundreds of varieties of stuff, it ought to be simple so that you can plan them easily. Make an effort to categorize the things of your child first. Devote some sections of the closet limited to his toys. You can see a sub category here. You could place very fragile toys in one area of the wardrobe and delicate toys and games in some other area of the wardrobe.\nHence this might help him access his toys and games quickly. Now next job is to devote some compartments of the wardrobe system to keep your child’s clothes. You must be well aware of your child’s favorite clothes. So you can place them in one section and other clothes in another section. The sneaker rack of the kids closet organizer can be used to place your child’s shoes in a mannered way.\nMake it a point to make these closets as easily accessible. Your child should not struggle to open his wardrobe system. It would be better if you select a wardrobe of less locking system or an available wardrobe system. Also, make sure that you make your child to follow the essential rules to maintain the closet. The size of your kid’s wardrobe should be small and stylish."

    "text": "Just what is ‘authenticity’ in a brand? To find out, let’s take a look at a craft that places authenticity as its holy grail. Acting.\nBrands and actors actually have a lot in common. Both play a character, tweaked and interpreted to be as affecting and engaging as possible. This character can be fictionalised, dramatised, or even wholesale made up, but at the core of a great performance for both is a point of undeniable human truth. This is the anchor that allows us as audiences and consumers to believe the character.\nFor most of history, the actor’s craft emphasised clarity. It had to, because when performing in front of a crowd, the people at the back needed to be able to see and hear what was going on. An actor needed to enunciate loudly and gesticulate wildly, not just to perform the play, but to have any kind of show at all that the audience could follow.\nThen Konstantin Stanislavski came along.\nHe was the originator of the cleverly-named Stanislavski system, which itself would spawn method acting. You’ve probably heard of it. Essentially, it tells actors that their performances could be more authentic and engaging by experientially recreating the character’s emotions in themselves.\nThey have to really ‘feel’ the role. For example, if the character’s father just died, the actor should bring back the emotions they felt in their own life when a loved one had died, and the performance should flow naturally from there. Most of your favourite actors today subscribe to these techniques in one way or another. A handful might even take it to extremes. We’re looking at you, Leo.\nThe System and The Method were actually developed for stage, but they just happened to coincide with the rise of film—and work out really well for it. Suddenly they had camera angles, speaker systems, editing and multiple takes. With all the constraints of live theatre gone, they could guarantee the same experience for the whole audience and drive an explosion in opportunities for nuanced, realistic performances.\nWe bring this up because the craft of advertising is very similar to acting and developed in an almost identical way. We as brands and advertisers take on a role—a character. Take a look at early advertising and you’ll find it as hammy as theatre actors of the 1910s. It was loud, blunt, and almost comically overstated.\nIt’s harder to pinpoint exactly when advertising began to mature, but Bill Bernbach’s (The ‘B’ in DDB) work would be a solid choice.\nHis ‘system’ doesn’t have a name, but centred around creativity to engage audiences, rather than the exaggerated hard sell that dominated until that point. He argued for uniqueness, believability, and consumer insight in advertising. In other words, examining what to say and how to say it, over how loud to yell.\nIt wasn’t enough that customers hear and understand the message. They had to ‘feel’ the brand in order to believe it. And in order for them to feel it, the people behind the brand have to as well. Almost all of us accept this to some extent.\nBernbach’s most famous work (probably Volkswagen and Avis) was in print, but his system happened to work out even better with the rise of television. In much the same ways that the big screen opened up tone and nuance for actors, the small screen followed suit for advertising.\nWhat can we learn from this parallel? We can take away that the bridge between actors and audiences is the character, with the most affecting performance built on a shared commonality between them. In the same way, a shared experience between advertisers and consumers through the brand makes it believable and engaging.\nWe need to ask that more. That’s what drives authenticity.\nBoth the disciplines of acting and advertising took coincidentally similar paths to their golden ages, which we still feel today. Both revolutions were triggered by the rise of screens, but the 21st century saw a new screen join the fray. Join us next time to find out how these paths diverge, and advertising has only just begun to recognise it."

Their products have been sold to 58 Armed Forces in 32 countries.\nThe Minister said: “The most recent example of this company’s strong focus on research is the decision to establish a centre of excellence in missile systems integration, including sophisticated electronics and laser guidance under the joint Invest NI, Department of Employment and Learning and EU-backed Research and Technology Development Programme.\n“This £4.5 million investment carries forward the company’s focus in this area which began in 1996 and has so far contributed to their success in securing six major contracts totalling over £400 million.

    "text": "Many take a loan to finance their purchases. It can be a financial leverage, a perfect tool to create holdings provided one is careful that indebtedness is only a transitional phase before making the capital gains on one's purchase. Common sense imposes to evaluate carefully the limits of one's investment capacities such as having noted the various existing loans before committing to a real estate operation with credits.\nThe bridging loan or loan for purchase and resale is offered to the owners who wish to purchase a new property before having sold the property put on the market.\nTaking a bridging loan offers the option to receive from the bank an advance on the future proceeds of the sale. The funds released thanks to this transition loan on short term enable the purchaser to have the time necessary to sell his/her previous lodging without having to sell it off cheap. Moreover, it is generally difficult to have the dates of purchase and sale converge.\nThis formula suits the purchase of a new property with a value inferior or equal to the property sold. In this case, the bank offers a \"dry\" bridge, that is to say a simple financial advance reimbursed by the sale of one's own property. Here, the advance shall thus be on short term: one year maximum and the borrower only reimburses monthly the interest of the loan.\nIf the amount of the bridging loan is not sufficient to finance the purchase of a new housing, the borrower thus has to cover the remaining amount by a property loan. As long as the first property is not sold, the borrower reimburses the loan interest every month of his bridging loan, in addition to the monthly instalments of his usual property loan. It is thus possible in this case to benefit from a differed payment: here, the interests are not paid back monthly but are capitalized. They thus increase progressively the amount to reimburse at the time of the sale of the property. The instalment thus much relieved but the total amount to pay back in the end shall be heavier by as much as the sale is executed late.\n3 - The Bridging loan with a \"total allowance\"\nThis option is granted for a term of 24 months. In this case, the borrower does not reimburse the loan interests during the first 12 months. If he/she sells his/her property before then, he/she pays back the capital of the bridging loan and the interest for the past months. If the borrower has not sold his/her property in the first 12 months of the bridging loan, from the thirteenth month he/she pays back the loan's interest as well as those of the first month.\nThe redeemable credit is the most common loan solution in France with individuals to finance properties. As its name suggests, it enable each taker of this sort of loans to pay amortize at the same time the capital owed as well as the interest in the same instalment.\nAs time goes by on your loan, the lower is the share of the interest, leaving space for more amortization of capital. We commonly say that we pay the interest of the loan during the first part and the capital in the second part. On each instalment we owe less and less capital to the bank, we \"amortize\" thus the property this way.\nHowever, depending on the terms of the contract, the instalments can also be decreasing or increasing if the instalments are flexible. Every year, on the anniversary date of the credit, the instalment can vary by more or less 30% depending on the wish and the capacity of the client.\nFinally, the interest rate of the redeemable credit can be fixed or flexible. If it is fixed, the borrower will lose out if the rates decrease and win if they increase. More often the borrowers favour the fixed rate for more safety. The flexible interest rate consists in a reference index and a margin. It is in general more attractive but revisable.\nDuring the whole term of the loan, the borrower only pays back monthly the interest of the loan or this capital borrowed is only reimbursed that the end of the loan, in one instalment.\nThe bank verifies the borrower's capacity of repayment imposing him a monthly payment on a savings product (a life insurance for example) for a pre-determined amount. This saving progressively supplied up to the capital borrowed represents a guarantee of reimbursement at the maturity of the loan. The main advantage of this loan is on a tax point of view: the investor can deduct the loan interests from his income, the total amount of which is higher than for a classic loan.\nDo not forget that, to take a property loan, the bank demands that the borrower takes a life insurance covering death and invalidity to cover its instalments and the capital borrowed. Despite its cost, this security offers some advantages: if the borrower dies during the term of the loan or were to become an invalid, this life insurance will reimburse the bank. Himself or his heirs will then have a house fully paid and a life insurance subject to the regime of the transfer outside of the inheritance. In case of a partial invalidity, the coverage will be in proportion with the level of incapacity.\nIn the scope of a purchase via a Civil Company in Real estate (SCI) the same personal documents should be provided for each partner."

Bob made me think about what they all have in common and I have no doubt that passion is the first criteria I look for when I interview a candidate.\nBut ‘passion’ is a very subjective term. How do you define it, identify it and select for it?\nYes, I look for people who know their subject, but they must also be willing to learn and go the extra mile. Passionate people talk about their purpose in life before talking about their qualifications. They are enthusiastic, contagiously positive – they make you feel good!\nThe opposite is the recipe for disaster. The damage an incorrect hire can wreak is huge.\nSo, as an interviewer, how can you encourage a candidate to show their passion?\nI always find it very helpful to start by articulating the purpose of the company and articulating my own enthusiasm for the job I do. Passionate people react immediately to concept of purpose because it’s what drives them. If your purpose resonates with them, you’ll see it straight away, not just in what they say but also in their body language. This spark and this connection are what I look for in a potential candidate.\nHiring the wrong person can be a disaster. It’s not just the work that’s at risk, it’s also the morale of the rest of your team, not to mention your reputation as a manager. Hiring requires full focus, great preparation and lots of time! Many managers don’t invest enough time for such crucial part of their job.\nApproach hiring the way you would approach giving a presentation to your boss or speaking in front of an audience of important people. Preparation and thoughtfulness at every stage of the process is essential.\nIt begins with the job description and posting. You can’t expect your HR team to support you in finding great candidates if you provide a vague or inaccurate description of what the role will entail.\nHave I clearly defined the job specs?\nHave I clearly articulated my requirements to the HR team?\nGo back to question 1, then rinse and repeat until you are ABSOLUTELY CLEAR!\nI’ve heard managers say: “Well, if they are too clever, I risk losing my job.” Don’t EVER think this way! Don’t settle for less, don’t be scared about driving a team of really clever and dedicated people; be proud of it. Your employees will make you better, they will make you believable and stronger as a manager. As long as you believe in your team, they will believe in you. Be genuinely interested in them, coach them to give their best and offer a clear sense of purpose. The results will be magical.\nI’ve been fortunate enough to work with and hire amazing teams: energetic, passionate and always ready to improve themselves. I’d like to thank them and encourage you to make passion a priority the next time you’re hiring. Because, for a manager, there’s nothing so satisfying as building an outstanding team.\nHaving been part of Luciano’s Team, I second all that!\nVeramente notevole Luciano, avrei voluto farti conoscere qualche manager italiano.\n‘Improve’ e’ una delle mie parole preferite….\nBellissimo articolo! Mi piace tantissimo l’originalità con la quale vesti le tue idee! Bravo e grazie per averci coinvolto con la forza della passione!"
